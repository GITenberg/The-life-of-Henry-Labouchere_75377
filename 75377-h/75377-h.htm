PREFACE
</p>

<p>
It would be unfair both to the reader and to the subject of
this memoir to let this book go forth without a word of
introduction.  The lot of Henry Labouchere, who was born
in the reign of William IV. and lived to see George V. on the
throne, was cast during a period of European development
as important, perhaps, as any that modern history records.
For certainly the most significant, if not the most salient,
fact in the history of modern Europe is that democratisation
of England which, in spite of many set-backs and obstacles,
has at length been, in principle at all events, definitely
achieved.  To-day we are all democrats, Tories and Radicals
alike.  In that process, the full significance of which has
still to unfold itself, Mr. Labouchere played a striking and
original part.  It was not always a successful one, but it
was always played honestly, daringly, and, above all,
characteristically.  Although a convinced, and in spite of himself,
if one may say so, even an enthusiastic Radical, no politician
was ever less of a party man.  His loyalty was given to
principles, not men, and some of his bitterest attacks both
in Parliament and in the press were reserved for Radical
Ministries that, according to his lights, were untrue to their
profession.  He was also, what is not so common in politics,
a thoroughly disinterested man.  He sought neither office
nor honour.  Circumstances placed him beyond the need
of money, and just as no personal feelings could ever blind
him to political shortcomings in his leaders, so the strongest
and most vehemently expressed disapproval of his opponents
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pvi"></a>vi}</span>
frequently went with a marked attachment to their persons,
and the strange thing is that he succeeded in convincing
both sides of the House of the genuineness of this emotionally
disinterested attitude.
</p>

<p>
The opinions of Englishmen are rarely disinterested, and
it should never be forgotten that Henry Labouchere was,
in fact, a Frenchman.  French by birth, he remained, to
the day of his death, French in his method of formation of
opinion, in his outlook on life, in the peculiar quality of his
wit.  It was this that enabled, or rather obliged, him to take
that curiously detached view of English ideals which was at
times so disconcerting even to those who thought that they
understood him.  Ideals, he held, were only entitled to
respect when translated into material currency.  "How
much £ s. d. does he believe in what he says?" he would ask
concerning some fervid prophet.  And if convinced that the
requisite materialisation had occurred, he would accept the
prophet as one more strange and amusing phenomenon in a
strange and amusing universe.  It would have never
occurred to him that because the prophet was sincere he was
right.  That was a matter for reason.  He once observed
to me, in his whimsical way, of a colleague, that the mere
denial of the existence of God did not entitle a man's
opinion to be taken without scrutiny on matters of greater
importance.  No "mere" Englishman could have said that.
That essential foreignness rendered him hard of comprehension
even to those who sympathised with his aims.  For
instance, he was a Radical, as sincere and convinced a Radical
as the late Mr. Stead, but in a very different way.  His
Radicalism was based on Reason.  It represented Reason
applied to that particular department of human affairs
called Politics, and so applied, one may add, in spite of the
irrationality of most of the men called Radical politicians.
English Radicalism, on the other hand, rests mainly on
humanitarian sentimentalism.  The <i>religion du clocher</i> of feudal
England has been largely replaced by a rival cult, the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pvii"></a>vii}</span>
hysterical excesses of which found in him a scathing critic.
He did not resent the hereditary principle in government
because it was unjust, but because it was absurd, and when
he fought some concrete instance of injustice, as he was
constantly doing, the emotional aspect of the case made
little, if any, appeal to him.  He disliked injustice on rational
and, as it were, æsthetic grounds.  He had no passionate
love of virtue, public or private; he thought it, on the whole,
a sound investment, but then even sound investments sometimes
go wrong.  In his personal outlook on things he was
as completely non-religious as a man could be.  He was not
anti-religious.  He fully recognised the utility of religious
belief in others, perhaps even in society at large, and he
based this recognition not so much on the hardness of men's
hearts as on the thickness of their heads.  But personally
he, Henry Labouchere, took no interest whatever in the
matter.  In philosophy he was a strict agnostic, owning
Hume, for whom he had the greatest admiration, and the
Kant of the <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i>, as his masters.  And
he was remarkably well read in the works of those
philosophers.
</p>

<p>
He was constitutionally suspicious of strong feelings or
enthusiasm of any kind.  All sensible people smoked, he
used to say, in order to protect themselves against such
disturbing factors.  He loathed every kind of humbug.
He did not, however, disdain it as a weapon.  During the
General Election of 1905 the Tories made a party cry of
Tariff Reform; he calmly observed one day, throwing down
his paper: "Well, of course I think we are right, but whether
we are or not, we've got all the bunkum on our side."
</p>

<p>
In his personal relations with others he was very sociable
and courteous, retaining even in old age the fine manners of
an earlier generation.  He was immensely kind-hearted,
and suffered fools, if not gladly, at least with politeness and
equanimity.  His love for children is well known.  There
was nothing he enjoyed more than giving children's parties,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pviii"></a>viii}</span>
and on these occasions would take any amount of personal
trouble to ensure the pleasure of his little friends.  My
earliest recollection of him is, as a child of eight or so, sitting
on his knee drinking in the most fascinating and horrible
tales of the Siege of Paris, which he would tell me by the
hour.  And almost my last recollection is of his interest in
a Christmas tree prepared for my own children on the very
day on which he took to his bed for the last time.
</p>

<p>
These traits make up a character more familiar in France
than elsewhere.  In his political ideas he resembled Clémenceau
more nearly than any English statesman, and in general
habit of mind he was a direct descendant of Voltaire.  In
character he was more like Fontenelle.  He had Fontenelle's
moral scepticism, his personal confidence in reason qualified
by his distrust of most people's reasoning powers, and his
profound sense of the dangers of enthusiasm.  People called
him a cynic; and, if that somewhat vague term denotes one
who attempts to discount the emotional factor in judgment,
who endeavours to see the bare facts in as dry and objective
a light as possible, a cynic he was.  But he was a
kind-hearted, even an affectionate cynic.  It was not easy to
win his regard, but, if you succeeded in winning it, you were
sure of it.  His own feelings he never expressed; this was
not because he had none, but because of the exaggerated
<i>pudeur</i> which he felt on the subject of the emotions.  There
was something both ridiculous and indecent to his mind in
even the most restrained exhibition of affection.  Briefly,
he may be said to have worn a fig-leaf over his heart.
</p>

<p>
A word or two as to the method and scope of this book.
In order to give a full and detailed account of the whole of
Labouchere's career, it would have been necessary to write
at least a dozen volumes; some sort of selection imposed
itself.  I have endeavoured to concentrate my own (and I
hope my readers') attention on Labouchere himself.  There
is a danger which lurks for the biographer of a public man
lest the environment of his hero&mdash;the narrative of the events
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pix"></a>ix}</span>
in which he played a part&mdash;should hang too loosely to his
figure.  There is also the danger that the frame, so to speak,
should not be given its due value in the portrait.  In order
to appreciate the part played in public affairs by an
individual, it is necessary to understand what is going on.  As
this book has been written for the general public, I have felt
it desirable to retell certain episodes in modern politics, in
which Mr. Labouchere played an important part, in greater
detail than would have been necessary had I been writing
for politicians.  In such retelling I claim no originality.  I
have followed standard authorities, and the point of view
of my narrative has been, to a great extent, that of
Mr. Labouchere himself, although, when I have come to the
conclusion that that point of view was mistaken, I have not
hesitated to say so.  In this way I hope that the reader may
be enabled to see the inevitability of much of Labouchere's
political action, which at the time, looked at piecemeal, may
have appeared gratuitously mischievous.
</p>

<p>
I feel I ought to call the reader's attention to the fact
that if Mr. Labouchere's many-sided life is considered as a
whole, his political proceedings represent but a small part
of his activity.  He had lived an average lifetime before he
seriously took up political work, and genuine as his principles
undoubtedly were, still politics were never really more to
him than a means of self-expression and, it must be said,
amusement.  He loved watching the spectacle of life, and
he came to find in the game of politics a sort of concentrated
version of life as a whole.  This feeling, the strongest perhaps
that he possessed, combined with a passion to enter as an
effective cause into the spectacle he loved, was responsible
for his political incarnation.  And he had a certain
half-perverse, half-childish love of mischief which he was not
always at pains to restrain, and which found in the intrigues
of parties and groups abundant scope for exercise.  It could
not have found so much scope elsewhere, and was the motive
power of much of his political action, particularly towards
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Px"></a>x}</span>
the end of his time in Parliament.  After his retirement
indeed, when politics had literally become nothing but a
game to him, he would watch the cards as they fell with
complete detachment from party views: "I wish I was
entering politics now as a young Tory blood," was a frequent
comment on public events during his last years.
</p>

<p>
Of course, he had his own way of putting things, which
was not that of other people, and this brings me to the part
in life as to which both friends and foes are agreed that he
achieved complete success.  Whatever else he was or was
not, everybody is agreed that he was the greatest English
wit since Sheridan.  His gently modulated voice had a good
deal to do with his conversational success, and the bland
quiet manner with which the most startling remarks would
be accompanied gave them weight, if not point.  Still, even
in cold print many of his sayings and appreciations will live
as long as men laugh from intellectual motives.  "I do not
mind Mr. Gladstone always having an ace up his sleeve,
but I do object to his always saying that Providence put it
there," is a dictum which will not soon be forgotten.  That
observation, gently drawled out one evening in the lobby of
the House of Commons, is a specimen of hundreds.  I am
persuaded that originally he had no intention of being witty,
but supposed his quips and paradoxes to represent the bare
facts expressed with the greatest economy of language.  It
is certain that no one was more surprised than he at the
entertainment people found in the <i>Letters of a Besieged
Resident</i>.  He soon discovered his reputation for wit and
deliberately made use of it, both as a shield and as a weapon
of defence.  It also served another purpose.  There was a
strong tendency to indolence in him that was gratified by
his success in turning off awkward or puzzling questions with
some witty or irrelevant remark.  If this analysis is correct,
it throws light on the nature of his wit, which consisted
largely in a naïve and shameless revelation of the <i>Secret de
Polichinelle</i>.  For he said what every one thought but didn't
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pxi"></a>xi}</span>
dare say.  The originality of his mind really consisted in
the complete absence in his case of those conventional
superstructures which imprison most of us.  When he replied
to some one who asked him if he liked Mme. X&mdash;&mdash;, "Oh
yes, I like her well enough, but I shouldn't mind if she
dropped down dead in front of me on the carpet," he was
only saying what many of us think but would never dream
of saying even to ourselves of some of our friends.
</p>

<p>
It is a commonplace of moralists to say that human
nature is full of contradictions.  A subtler critic of man than
the mere moralist would add that much of men's time is
spent in smoothing out, or, at all events, conciliating, these
contradictions.  We choose a possible type of humanity&mdash;Aristotle,
or some other Greek, gave an exhaustive list of
them&mdash;and see ourselves in the part we have selected.
According to our imaginative power and our strength of
will we succeed more or less in playing that part at least for
social purposes.  Years pass and the mask grows to the face,
as in the case of Mr. Beerbohm's <i>Happy Hypocrite</i>, and
our friends and acquaintances cease in time to distinguish
between our pose and our character.  But there are moments
when the mask cracks and close observers have their
surprises.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Labouchere gave up early in life any consecutive
attempt to make himself appear different to his real nature.
A fragment of an early diary which I have utilised does
indeed discuss the possibilities of success to the writer, and
criticises, in scathing terms, achievements up-to-date.  But
this document, interesting and amusing as it is, is itself but
a piece of boyish introspectiveness.  In point of fact he was
a terribly sincere person, partly from pride and partly from
indolence.  Had he been willing to condescend to insincerity,
he would have been too lazy to do so for long.  Here, then,
was an additional stumbling-block.  It is easy enough to
understand a pose, or even a succession of poses, but a person
who says neither more nor less than exactly what he means,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pxii"></a>xii}</span>
and means exactly what he says, not because he thinks he
ought to do so, or wishes to be understood as doing so, but
because so, and not otherwise, his nature spontaneously
expresses itself, is, in our present social state, almost
unintelligible.  What saved him under these circumstances from
becoming a "prophet" was the pliability of intelligence
that enabled him to understand other people and the sense
of humour that enabled him to enjoy them.
</p>

<p>
I have selected from the voluminous correspondence put
at my disposal only those letters which throw most light on
Mr. Labouchere's state of mind and the part he played in
political events with which he was connected.
</p>

<p>
I have to thank my many relatives and friends who have
allowed me to make use of their letters from Mr. Labouchere,
and also my cousin, M. Georges Labouchère, for communicating
the result of his researches on the life of my
great-grandfather.  Among old friends of Mr. Labouchere, who
have given me personal reminiscences of him, I have
especially to thank Mrs. Emily Crawford, Mr. Wilfrid Blunt,
Lord Welby, Sir Audley Gosling, and Mr. Robert Bennett,
the editor of <i>Truth</i>, whose help has been invaluable in the
narrative of Mr. Labouchere's founding of <i>Truth</i> and of its
subsequent fortunes.  Most of all, my thanks are due to
Mr. Thomas Hart Davies, without whose constant sympathy
and assistance this biography could not have been
written.

<h1>
THE LIFE OF LABOUCHERE
</h1>

<p><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br>
THE LABOUCHERE FAMILY
</h3>

<p>
Some forty miles south of Bayonne, on the right bank of
the Gave, lies the little town of Orthez, the ancient
capital of Béarn.  Famous for the obstinacy of its resistance
to the apostolic spirit of Louis XIV. and the excellence of
its manufactured cloth, Orthez was further distinguished
during the Wars of Religion by the possession of a Protestant
university founded by Jeanne d'Albret in which Theodore
Beza was professor.  In 1664, the most Christian King sent
his intendant Foucault to deal with the nest of heretics.
Foucault did not waste time in theological subtleties, but
gave the inhabitants twenty days in which to conform under
penalty of a dragonnade.  They did so unanimously, but
there still remain more Protestants in Orthez than in any
other town of Béarn.
</p>

<p>
Among the cloth merchants of Orthez none were more
distinguished than the Labouchères.  According to the
Frères Haag, the compilers of <i>La France Protestante</i>, their
name should be Barrier de Labouchère, the patronymic
which they came to adopt being in reality the name of a
property in the possession of the family.  The earliest
known ancestor of the Labouchères seems to have been a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P2"></a>2}</span>
certain Jean Guyon Barrier, who married in 1621 one
Catherine de la Broue.
</p>

<p>
Pierre-César, the founder of the British branch of the
family and the grandfather of the subject of this memoir,
was born at The Hague in 1772.  He was the second son of
Matthieu Labouchère and Marie-Madeleine Molière.  His
father, who, in consequence of the revocation of the Edict
of Nantes, had been sent to England for his education, had
subsequently settled in Holland.  Pierre-César was sent at
the age of thirteen to learn his uncle Pierre's business at
Nantes,[<a id="chap01fn1text"></a><a href="#chap01fn1">1</a>] where he remained until 1790, at which date he
entered the house of Hope at Amsterdam as French clerk.
In this humble position he laid the foundations of the great
fortune and financial career which were to be his.  The rise
of the young French clerk was rapid.  In six years he was a
partner in the house of Hope and had married Dorothy,
sister of Alexander Baring, who had become a partner in
the Dutch firm at the same time as his French brother-in-law.
The well-known story of the clever ruse by which
Pierre-César won the hand of his bride and also his
partnership in the house of Hope was told to the present writer
some twenty years ago by the Rev. Alexander Baring[<a id="chap01fn2text"></a><a href="#chap01fn2">2</a>] as
follows:
</p>

<p>
Pierre-César was sent by Mr. John Hope to England to
see Sir Francis Baring on some business, and fell in love
with Sir Francis's third daughter Dorothy.  Before leaving
England he asked Sir Francis to permit him to become
engaged to his daughter.  Sir Francis refused.  Pierre-César
then said: "Would it make any difference to your
decision if you knew that Mr. Hope was about to take me
into partnership?"  Sir Francis unhesitatingly admitted that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P3"></a>3}</span>
it would.  Pierre-César then went back to Holland and
suggested to Mr. Hope that he might be taken into partnership.
On Mr. Hope discouraging the idea, he said: "Would
it make any difference to your decision if you knew that I
was engaged to the daughter of Sir Francis Baring?"  Mr. Hope
replied, "Certainly."  Whereupon the wily clerk
said: "Well, I am engaged to Miss Dorothy Baring."  That
very day he was able to write to Sir Francis announcing the
news of his admission to partnership in the house of Hope,
and in the same letter he claimed the hand of his bride.[<a id="chap01fn3text"></a><a href="#chap01fn3">3</a>]
</p>

<p>
The following picture of Pierre-César by a contemporary
is interesting.  The writer was Vincent Nolte, for many
years a clerk in the house of Hope at Amsterdam.  "Mr.
Labouchère was at that time but twenty-two, yet ere long
assumed the highly respectable position of head of the firm,
the first in the world, and studied the manners of a French
courtier previous to the Revolution: these he soon made so
thoroughly his own, that they seemed to be a part of his own
nature.  He made a point of distinguishing himself in everything
he undertook by a certain perfection, and carried this
feeling so far that, on account of the untractable lack of
elasticity of his body and a want of ear for music which nature
had denied him, he for eighteen years deemed it necessary
to take dancing-lessons, because he saw that others surpassed
him in the graceful accomplishment.  It was almost painful
to see him dance.  The old school required, in the French
quadrille, some <i>entrechats</i> and one or two pirouettes, and the
delay they occasioned him always threw him out of time.
I have often seen the old gentleman, already more than fifty,
return from a quadrille covered with perspiration.  Properly
speaking, he had no refined education, understood but very
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P4"></a>4}</span>
little of the fine arts, and, notwithstanding his shrewdness
and quickness of perception, possessed no natural powers of
wit, and consequently was all the more eager to steal the
humour of other people.  He once repeated to myself as a
witty remark of his own to one of his clerks, the celebrated
answer of De Sartines, a former chief of the French police,
to one of his subordinates who asked for an increase of pay
in the following words: 'You do not give me enough&mdash;still
I must live!'  The reply he got was: 'I do not perceive the
necessity of that!'  Now, so hard-hearted a response was
altogether foreign to Mr. Labouchère's disposition, as he
was a man of most excellent and generous feeling.  He had,
assuredly, without intention, fallen into the singular habit
of speaking his mother-tongue&mdash;the French&mdash;with an almost
English intonation, and English with a strong French accent.
But he was most of all remarkable for the chivalric idea of
honour in mercantile transactions, which he constantly
evinced, and which I never, during my whole life, met with
elsewhere, in the same degree, however numerous may have
been the high-minded and honourable merchants with whom
I have been thrown in contact.  He fully possessed what the
French call <i>des idées chevaleresques</i>."[<a id="chap01fn4text"></a><a href="#chap01fn4">4</a>]
</p>

<p>
In 1800 Pierre-César re-established himself for a time in
England, whither Hope's had been temporarily transferred
after the invasion of Holland by Pichegru.  A few years
later he became involved in an interesting and delicate
political negotiation.
</p>

<p>
In April, 1810, Napoleon, whose marriage with Marie
Louise had filled him with peaceful aspirations, surveyed the
world that he had conquered and decided that, for the
moment, he had conquered enough.  To consolidate his
empire and his dependencies, peace was necessary.  The
only obstacle to peace was England&mdash;England who had never
bowed before his eagles and only grudgingly admitted his
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P5"></a>5}</span>
existence.  Negotiation with England was imperative, but
how to negotiate, and by what means?  What had he to
offer Mr. Pitt?  A substantial argument presented itself
in the condition of Holland.  Louis Buonaparte had
disappointed his autocratic brother as an allied sovereign, and
it was the Emperor's intention to remove him from the Dutch
throne and unite the whole of the Netherlands to the Empire.
This course could not fail to be disagreeable to the English,
who would then be flanked by the French on two sides.  So
it occurred to Napoleon that, by leaving Holland her
independence, he would be giving England a substantial <i>quid pro
quo</i> for the withdrawal of British troops from the Peninsula.
Evidently, however, he could not himself directly open
negotiations.  Not only would such action lower his prestige,
but it was doubtful whether those infernal islanders would
consent to treat with him.  The negotiations had to be
opened by way of Holland.  King Louis' Government must
not appear in it.  There were prudent men of affairs there
who could be trusted with the delicate task.  Louis was
delighted with the idea.  He would retain his estate as an
independent sovereign, the commerce of Europe would
once more circulate freely to the replenishment of his
subjects' coffers, and his terrible brother's ambitions would be
effectively circumscribed.
</p>

<p>
Fouché, who, unknown to the Emperor, had already sent
a private agent to London to discuss with the British Cabinet
possible conditions of peace, entered enthusiastically into
the project and designated Pierre-César as in every way the
most suitable person to be entrusted with the affair.  His
position in the world of business as a partner of Hope in
Amsterdam and of Baring in London was of the highest, and
his father-in-law, Sir Francis Baring, who had been one of
the principal directors of "John Company," was an intimate
friend of Wellesley, the English Foreign Secretary, with
whom he had spent some time in India.
</p>

<p>
Labouchère was to present himself informally to Wellesley,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P6"></a>6}</span>
not as an envoy of the King of Holland and still less as the
mouthpiece of Napoleon, but in the names of Roell, Van
Der Heim, and Mollerus, three Dutch statesmen who professed
to have been initiated by their King into all the secrets
of the French Cabinet.  He was to explain to the English
Foreign Secretary that the marriage of Napoleon had altered
his position and had caused him to desire the peace of Europe
as a necessary condition of the consolidation of his Empire,
and that, in order to induce the English Government to
abandon hostilities, he was prepared to forego his intention
of uniting Holland to his dominions.  The Dutch Cabinet,
aware of the Emperor's views, had hastened to open informal
communications in order at one stroke to secure the peace
of Europe and to retain the independence of their country.
All having been arranged, Labouchère crossed from Brielle
to Yarmouth and posted to London on his secret mission.
</p>

<p>
As a matter of fact the moment was not well chosen for
its success.  After the retirement, on the Catholic question,
of Grenville and Grey, who had continued the Fox-Pitt
coalition, the old Duke of Portland, who had been Home
Secretary in Mr. Pitt's first Government, became Prime
Minister.  He maintained his power with difficulty: Canning
and Castlereagh, respectively Home Secretary and Foreign
Minister, quarrelled, left the Cabinet in order to fight a duel,
and did not return to it.  Lord Chatham did not survive
the results of the expedition to Walcheren, and shortly
afterwards Portland himself died.  Mr. Perceval and Lord
Wellesley were the most important persons left in the Cabinet.
Perceval, who had been Portland's Chancellor of the
Exchequer, kissed hands as Prime Minister on December 2,
1809, and Wellesley took the place of Bathurst as Foreign
Secretary.  Perceval was a clever lawyer and a bitter and
prejudiced Tory; Wellesley's hereditary politics were qualified
by suave manners, an enlightened spirit, and an unusual
talent for clear and eloquent statement.  Less passionate
than Perceval, he had not the Prime Minister's influence
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P7"></a>7}</span>
with the party, but he enjoyed an immense reputation in
the country which was daily increased by the news of his
brother's gallant deeds at the front.  The position of the
Government, in spite of their parliamentary majority, was
not very strong.  They held their power by that most
uncertain tenure&mdash;success in arms.
</p>

<p>
The opposition, led by Grenville and Grey, rejoiced in
the avowed favour of the Prince of Wales, whom an accident,
such was the state of the King's health, might any day call
to the regency, and even to the throne.  The Prince had
openly declared himself against the war, and the leaders of
the opposition argued forcibly, in and out of season, against
its continuance.  The militarism of the country was not,
however, to be checked in this way.  The news of one victory
outweighed much argument.  But news was not always of
victories.  Forty thousand English troops had been forced
to retire before Antwerp, with a loss of fifteen thousand from
death and disease.  This calamity more than balanced the
victory of Talavera.  Perceval stuck to his war policy with
blind and furious determination.  He no doubt felt that his
one chance of retaining office was to do so.  Wellesley, on
the other hand, in spite of the glory won by his family
through the war, was open to reason on the subject.  He had
already received politely Captain Fagan, a high officer in
Condé's army, whom Fouché had sent over on his own
responsibility to feel the way toward conditions of peace.  He
had received him politely, but had answered him evasively
to the effect that the King's Government was by no means
bent on continuing the war at <i>all</i> costs, but would gladly
entertain proposals of peace if they were advanced by
responsible, fully accredited agents and were compatible
with the honour of the two nations.  Labouchère was unable
to get anything more definite out of him.  But Wellesley,
reserved with the French agent, opened himself more fully
to his old friend Sir Francis Baring.  To him he explained
that no member of the Cabinet believed in Napoleon's good
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P8"></a>8}</span>
faith.  He personally saw nothing in Labouchère's mission
but a trap laid for English public opinion by the supreme
adventurer, and judged that nothing was to be gained by
playing into his hand.  Moreover, the Government would
never abandon Spain to Joseph or Sicily to Murat, and
would in no circumstances consent to the loss of Malta.
The fullest preliminary assurances on these points were the
<i>sine qua non</i> of any successful negotiation.
</p>

<p>
Sir Francis Baring, who was a sagacious man, communicated
this conversation, together with his personal comments
thereon, to Labouchère.  It was evident, he said,
that England had grown accustomed to the war, and would
not abandon it except under the stress of a reverse impossible
to predict, and that the nation would never lose all they had
fought for in the Peninsula by yielding Spain to a Buonaparte
prince.  He suggested, without any official authority, an
arrangement which, leaving Malta to England, would give
Naples to Murat, Sicily to the Neapolitan Bourbons, and
would restore Spain to Ferdinand, save for the provinces on
the French side of the Ebro, which might be given to
Napoleon as an indemnity for the expenses of the war.
Convinced that nothing further was to be obtained in London,
Labouchère returned to Holland and sent to King Louis at
Paris the meagre results of his mission.  Unfortunately,
Napoleon was as well accustomed to war as England.  As soon as
he had received Labouchère's reply, he gave up the notion of
using Holland as a weapon against England and determined
to settle his affairs with his brother independently of the
general situation.  Nevertheless, he did not wish to entirely
let fall the indirect relations on which Labouchère had
entered with the English Cabinet, and sent him a reply to
be transmitted through Sir Francis Baring to Lord Wellesley.
The Emperor's reply was perhaps more statesmanlike than
might have been expected.  If England was accustomed to
the war, the French were even more in their element on the
battlefield.  France was victorious, rich, prosperous, obliged,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P9"></a>9}</span>
no doubt, to pay a high price for sugar and coffee, but not
reduced to the point of doing without those luxuries.  She
could support the situation for a long time yet.  If, in these
conditions, he thought of peace, it was because in the new
position created by his marriage with an Austrian archduchess
he was anxious to terminate the struggle between the old
order and the new.  As for the kingdoms he had created,
it was not to be thought that he would sacrifice any of them.
Never would he dethrone his brothers Joseph, Murat, Louis,
and Jerome.  But the destinies of Portugal and Sicily were
still in suspense; these two countries, Hanover, the Hanseatic
cities, and the Spanish colonies might still be dealt with.
In any case, it might be possible to mitigate the horrors of
war.  He had been obliged to reply by the decrees of Berlin
and Milan to the orders-in-council issued by the British
Cabinet, and the sea had been converted into a stage for
violence of every description.  This state of things was
perhaps more dangerous for England than for France, since
an Anglo-American war might easily result.  If the English
Government agreed with these appreciations they had but
to relax their laws of blockade.  France would follow suit,
Holland and the Hanseatic towns would retain their
independence, the sea would be opened to neutrals, the war would
lose some of its bitterness, and, possibly, in time a complete
understanding between the two nations might be reached.
Such was Napoleon's, on the whole, judicious reply, and on
these terms, and on these terms only, was Labouchère
authorised to make any further attempts at negotiation.
</p>

<p>
But Napoleon counted without Fouché.  That brilliant
and unscrupulous person, who had been recently raised
to the important Ministry of Police with the title of Duc
d'Otrante, was a peace fanatic.  In every day that the war
continued he saw danger to the Empire.  The failure of the
Labouchère mission, in which he no doubt felt his self-love
wounded, since he had himself indicated the envoy,
disappointed him profoundly.  He determined to bring about
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P10"></a>10}</span>
peace himself, and relied on his success to justify himself in
the Emperor's eyes.  It would have been a dangerous thing
to do under any government: it was a piece of insanity
under a master so absolute, so vigilant, as Napoleon.  He
accordingly sent one Ouvrard to Amsterdam to urge Labouchère
to reopen negotiations with the British Cabinet on
conditions much more favourable to England than the
Emperor had made.  Labouchère naturally thought that
Fouché once more represented Napoleon, and recommenced
negotiations on a basis much more satisfactory to English
policy.  The basis was different indeed.  According to
Ouvrard, the Emperor would modify his views on Sicily,
Spain, the Spanish colonies, Portugal, and Holland; he was
earnestly desirous of peace, and he shared the hostility of the
British Cabinet to the Americans.  In order to give Labouchère
more credit with Wellesley, Fouché offered to give up
to him a mysterious personage called Baron Kolli, an English
police agent, who had been visiting Valencay to arrange the
escape of Ferdinand.  Kolli had been arrested by the French
troops who had charge of the imprisoned King.  The arrest
had been considered an important event by the Cabinet of
St. Cloud.  To all this Ouvrard added a good deal of his
own, and Labouchère could not do otherwise than believe
what he was told.  Accordingly he reopened negotiations
by letter with Wellesley.[<a id="chap01fn5text"></a><a href="#chap01fn5">5</a>]
</p>

<p>
In the following month, Napoleon, who was making one of
his tours of personal inspection in the Netherlands, discussed
the Labouchère negotiations with his brother Louis at
Antwerp.  By a curious chance he had caught sight on his
journey of Ouvrard, who was on his way from Amsterdam
to Paris.  The Emperor's promptness of mind had at once
suggested to him that Ouvrard, who enjoyed the favour of
Fouché and had business relations with Labouchère, was
probably mixing himself up in what did not concern him,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P11"></a>11}</span>
perhaps giving advice which was not wanted, or trying to
float some speculation on the probabilities of peace.  With
the presentiment of his genius he at once forbade Labouchère
to have any relations with Ouvrard and ordered him to send
immediately all the correspondence that had been exchanged
between Amsterdam and London to the King.  Labouchère
at once communicated all his own letters and those he had
received from London.
</p>

<p>
The blow fell on June 2 at St. Cloud, where the Emperor,
the day after his return from Holland, convoked a Council
of Ministers to meet him.  Fouché, in charge of the most
important portfolio of the imperial Cabinet, was naturally
present.  Napoleon turned and rent him.  What was
Ouvrard doing in Holland?  Had Fouché sent him there?
Was he or was he not an accomplice of this preposterous
intrigue?  Fouché, surprised and upset by this sudden and
unexpected attack, could find nothing better to say than
that Ouvrard was a busybody who was always mixing himself
up in other people's business and that it was wiser to
pay no attention to anything he might say.  The astute
personage must indeed have been upset to attempt to "pay"
Napoleon with such words.  Ouvrard and his papers were
at once seized, the mission being entrusted not to Fouché,
who as Minister of the Police would naturally have received
such an order, but to Sazary, an aide-de-camp whom the
Emperor had made Duc de Rovigo and in whom he had
complete confidence.  Ouvrard's papers revealed at once
the extent to which the intrigue had been pushed and of
Fouché's complicity.  The next day Fouché was dismissed
from the Ministry of Police, where he was succeeded by
Rovigo, and appointed Governor of Rome.  When Napoleon
had anything to do he did it quickly.
</p>

<p>
He did not rest there, however.  He was determined to
get to the <i>fin fond</i> of these singular negotiations.  Ouvrard,
kept in prison, was constantly examined, and Labouchère
was summoned to Paris and ordered to bring all the papers
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P12"></a>12}</span>
still in his hands.  It appeared, from a comparison of these
with those already seized, that Labouchère had acted in
perfectly good faith, and the whole responsibility rested
with Fouché and Ouvrard.  Fouché's disgrace was complete.
As soon as the Emperor discovered the episode of the Fagan
mission he turned once more on the luckless minister and
demanded all the papers relative to that affair.  Fouché
replied that they were of no importance and that he had
burned them.  Napoleon, on hearing this, gave way to one
of his appalling exhibitions of rage, took away from Fouché
the governorship of Rome, and exiled him to Aix in Provence.
So ended this curious affair in which Pierre-César Labouchère
had served his country faithfully and intelligently to the
extent which circumstances permitted.  Some years later
he was to serve his country perhaps more signally, and
certainly more effectively.
</p>

<p>
When in 1817 France was beginning the task of reconstruction,
the principal difficulty in the way of the ministers
of Louis XVIII. was the very serious financial situation.
By the treaty of November 20 of the preceding year, the
country was pledged to pay to foreigners no less than seven
hundred million francs in money in the course of five years,
with an additional sum of a hundred and thirty million for
the pay of the 150,000 foreign troops which occupied the
country.  There were also numerous debts, both at home
and abroad, the payment of which had been guaranteed by
the treaties of 1814 and 1815.  The ordinary revenue was
useless to meet such heavy charges, and extraordinary
taxation, in the state of the country, would have spelt ruin.
It was necessary to have recourse to credit.  But how to
obtain a loan?  France was not in a state which could
inspire financiers with much confidence.  In these
circumstances Messrs. Labouchère and Baring once more
placed themselves at the service of the French Government.
They purchased nearly twenty-seven million francs' worth
of government five per cent. <i>rente</i>, and thus restored French
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P13"></a>13}</span>
credit.  Their action was, no doubt, not purely disinterested,
as they bought the <i>rente</i> at an average price of 56.50 and
obtained an interest of nine per cent. on their money.  Still,
the difficulty of the moment was to find anybody to do it
at any price.[<a id="chap01fn6text"></a><a href="#chap01fn6">6</a>]  A private journal of the period, kept by the
husband of a niece of Sir Francis Baring, consequently a
first cousin by marriage of Mme. Pierre-César Labouchère,
gives the following account of the transaction:[<a id="chap01fn7text"></a><a href="#chap01fn7">7</a>] "The
'Alliance Loan' of the Barings at Paris in 1816 probably
doubled his (Pierre-César's) fortune, and he soon after
quitted business, and settled altogether in England, living
at Hylands, a property he bought in Essex, and in Hamilton
Place, where his home was frequented by many distinguished
people and diplomatists."
</p>

<p>
Two sons were born to Pierre-César and Dorothy Labouchère.
The elder, Henry, was born in 1798, and made for
himself a social and political career of decided distinction,
as a Whig of the old school, a certain primness and
conventionality of character enabling him to perform the part
successfully in private as in public life.  He took a first-class
in classics at Oxford, and in 1832 found himself a Lord
of the Admiralty.  He became subsequently Vice-President
of the Board of Trade, Under-Secretary to the Colonies,
President of the Board of Trade, Chief Secretary of Ireland,
Secretary of State for the Colonies, and was raised to the
peerage in 1859, when he assumed the title of Baron Taunton,
choosing the name of the borough he had represented in
Parliament for thirty years.  It was at Taunton in 1835
that he opposed and defeated Dizzy by a majority of a
hundred and seventy, when, on his appointment as Master
of the Mint under Lord Melbourne, he offered himself to
his constituents for re-election.  His primness and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P14"></a>14}</span>
conventionality found on this occasion an admirable foil in the
manner and appearance of his opponent, who was "very
showily attired in a bottle-green frock coat, a waistcoat of
the most extravagant pattern, the front of which was almost
covered with glittering chains, and in fancy pattern
pantaloons."  The judicious electors of Taunton preferred
Mr. Labouchere's more solid qualities.
</p>

<p>
Lord Taunton died very suddenly on July 13, 1869.  He
was twice married, first to Frances, daughter of Sir Thomas
Baring,[<a id="chap01fn8text"></a><a href="#chap01fn8">8</a>] and secondly to Lady Mary Howard, a daughter of
Lord Carlisle.  He left no sons.  Consequently the bulk
of his fortune descended to his brother John Labouchere's
eldest son Henry, the future member for Northampton and
editor of <i>Truth</i>.
</p>

<p>
The younger Henry Labouchere's earliest recollections
carried him back to his childish visits to his grandfather in
Hamilton Place, where Prince Talleyrand, then Ambassador
to the Court of St. James (1830-34), was a frequent visitor.
"I have always taken a special interest in Talleyrand," he
wrote when he was sixty, "because he gave me when a child
a very gorgeous box of dominoes."[<a id="chap01fn9text"></a><a href="#chap01fn9">9</a>]
</p>

<p>
The elder Henry Labouchere does not seem at first sight
to have shared any traits with his nephew and namesake.
The only point on which they may be said to have agreed
was their love for America.  Lord Taunton as a young man
travelled much in the United States with Lord Derby, and
he had important business interests there as well as in South
America, arising out of the commercial enterprises of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P15"></a>15}</span>
house of Hope.  He acquired in the course of his travels a
strong liking for American institutions and a genuine affection
for the American people, a feeling which, as we shall see,
was shared by his nephew.
</p>

<p>
Mr. John Labouchere predeceased Lord Taunton by six
years, and it was often presumed by persons who knew the
family but slightly that the younger Henry Labouchere was
the son of Lord Taunton, which mistake gave the young wit
the opportunity of making one of his best-known repartees.
On one occasion a gentleman, to whom Henry was introduced
for the first time, opened the conversation by remarking:
"I have just heard your father make an admirable speech
in the House of Lords."  "The House of Lords!" replied
Mr. Labouchere, assuming an air of intense interest, "well,
I always <i>have</i> wondered where my father went to when he
died."

Bros., where he probably heard the story.

to be true.

CHAPTER II
<br><br>
CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH
</h3>

<p class="t3">
(1831-1853)
</p>

<p>
John Peter Labouchere,[<a id="chap02fn1text"></a><a href="#chap02fn1">1</a>] the younger son of
Pierre-César Labouchère, was a partner in the firm
of Hope at Amsterdam, and, later, a partner in the bank of
Williams, Deacon, Thornton, and Labouchere.  He married
Mary Louisa Du Pre,[<a id="chap02fn2text"></a><a href="#chap02fn2">2</a>] second daughter of Mr. James Du
Pre of Wilton Park in Buckinghamshire, and granddaughter
of Sir William Maxwell of Monteith, by whom he had a
family of three sons and six daughters, of whom one son and
four daughters are still living.  He was the owner of Broome
Hall in Surrey, and his town house was at 16 Portland Place.
He was an extremely religious man and well known for his
charitable and philanthropic labours.  At one period his
elder brother, Lord Taunton, then Mr. Henry Labouchere,
also had a house in Portland Place, and he used to relate that
he was constantly pestered by persons confusing him with
his brother the banker, who called to ask for his help and
patronage with regard to various evangelical enterprises.
It was his habit to reply to them: "You have made a mistake,
sir; the good Mr. Labouchere lives at No. 16."
</p>

<p>
Henry Du Pre, the eldest son of John Labouchere, was
born at 16 Portland Place on November 9, 1831.  His
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P17"></a>17}</span>
education, had he been a docile pupil, would, according to
his father's wishes, have been that of a conventional English
boy with some reasonable expectations of a fine career in
the financial or the diplomatic world, into either of which he
had an easy <i>entrée</i> through the influence of the Labouchere
family.  But he displayed, at the very beginning of his
career, a curious and original character, which did not seem
to follow easily any of the known paths of learning marked
out for the youth of his period.  The earliest repartee
recorded of him was made to the headmaster of the private
school to which he was sent at the age of six.  Before breakfast,
the morning after his arrival, the new boys were placed
in a row, and asked whether they had all washed their teeth.
One by one they answered in the affirmative, until came the
turn of Henry.  "No," he answered firmly.  "And pray
why not?" wound up the master indignantly, after a long
lecture on the enormity of the crime of neglecting the
cleanliness of the teeth.  "Because I haven't got any," smiled
Henry suddenly.  He was just at the stage of changing his
baby teeth, and his toothless gums were displayed for the
full benefit of the discomfited moralist.[<a id="chap02fn3text"></a><a href="#chap02fn3">3</a>]  Nearly fifty years
later Labouchere published the following account of his
school-days:
</p>

<p>
"When I was a boy I was sent to a school which was kept
by one of the most ill-conditioned ruffians that ever wielded
a cane.  He used to suffer from lumbago (this was my only
consolation), and would crawl on his hands and knees into
the schoolroom; then he would rear up and commence caning
a few boys, merely, I truly believe, from a notion that the
exercise would be beneficial to his muscles.  The man was
ignorant, brutal, mean, and cruel, and yet his school somehow
had a reputation as an excellent one&mdash;mainly, I suspect,
because he had the effrontery to charge a high price for the
privilege of being at it."[<a id="chap02fn4text"></a><a href="#chap02fn4">4</a>]
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P18"></a>18}</span>
</p>

<p>
He went to Eton in the September of 1844, and was
entered at the house of Edward Balston, who afterwards
became headmaster.  Dr. Hawtrey, whose classical teaching
has been described as "more picturesque than useful," was
headmaster during the three years and a half that Henry
Labouchere was at the school.  The boy seems to have been
a fairly idle scholar, and nothing remarkable in the way of a
sportsman.  He was exceedingly small for his age and, in
consequence, a light weight, so that he was much in request
on summer afternoons as a "cox."  Among his contemporaries
at Eton were the late Lord Avebury, the late Sir
George Tryon, Lord Roberts, the late Sir Arthur Blackwood,
Sir Algernon West, and Lord Welby.  Lord Welby recollects
that he had, even in his Eton days, the dry, cynical manner
and original mode of verbal expression which, later on,
marked him out from his fellows.
</p>

<p>
Labouchere fell under a suspicion of bullying whilst at
Balston's, and the consequences he was forced to undergo are
interesting as illustrative of the Eton justice of the forties.
He was in the fifth form, and the elder boys of his house
summoned the captain of the lower boys, one Barton, who
was a good deal bigger than Labouchere, to fight him in the
house.  Barton had no quarrel on his own account with
Labouchere&mdash;it was a case of representative justice.  The
fight was arranged to take place in one of the rooms after
tea, it being the uncomfortable practice in those days always
to fight after a meal.  Labouchere and Barton punched
away at each other for an hour or so, until the big boys went
down to supper, when they were allowed to rest.  After the
elders had supped, the fight was renewed until Labouchere
succumbed.  However, it was generally allowed that he had
made a good show before a bigger man than himself.  The
next day the eyes of the combatants were bunged up, their
noses swollen to bottle size, and their complexions coloured
bright blue and green with bruises.  They could not go into
school.  Balston was obliged to take notice of what had
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P19"></a>19}</span>
happened, which he did with well-simulated indignation, and,
when they were able to return to school, reported them to
Hawtrey, who "swished" them both.[<a id="chap02fn5text"></a><a href="#chap02fn5">5</a>]
</p>

<p>
Another contemporary of Mr. Labouchere's at Eton, the
late Frederick Morton Eden, related a story about him at a
dinner given to him some years ago, as the senior "Old
Etonian," in the School Hall of the College.  Whilst the old
chapel was being restored, a temporary chapel of wood and
iron was run up.  The corrugated iron roof made the heat
intolerable during the summer months, so Labouchere hit
upon a plan to put a stop to the nuisance of "chapel in the
shanty."  One boy was to pretend to faint and four others
were to carry him out.  A fifth was to follow bearing the
hats of the performers.  The plan worked admirably.  The
service was brought to a temporary stop and the boys, as
soon as they were outside, scampered merrily off and
procured some agreeable refreshment.  The repetition of this
comedy, of course, aroused the suspicion of the masters, but
nevertheless, like many of Labouchere's intrigues in later
life, it produced eventually the desired effect.  There was
no more chapel during the hot weather until the restoration
of the old chapel was complete.
</p>

<p>
A reminiscence of his Eton days that Mr. Labouchere
was fond of relating has already found its way into print,
but will bear repetition, as all may not have read it.  One
day, his store of pocket-money being at high-water mark, he
conceived the notion of doing the man about town for an
hour or two; so, having dressed himself with scrupulous care,
he sallied forth, and, entering the best hotel in the place,
engaged a private room, and in a lordly manner ordered a
bowl of punch.  The waiter stared but brought the liquor,
and went away.  The boy, having tasted it, found it
horrible.  He promptly poured it into the lower compartment
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P20"></a>20}</span>
of an antique oak sideboard.  He waited a little to see
whether it would run out on to the carpet.  Luckily the
drawer was watertight, and Labouchere rang the bell again
and proudly ordered from the amazed waiter a second bowl
of punch.  He poured this also into the oak sideboard, and
in a few minutes rang for the bill, tipped the waiter majestically,
and swaggered out of the hotel, quite satisfied that he
had won the admiration and respect of the whole staff.
</p>

<p>
After the Christmas half of 1847, Labouchere left Eton.
He was then in his seventeenth year, and, before going to
the university, it was thought advisable to place him for a
year or two with a private tutor.
</p>

<p>
It is interesting, before we leave Labouchere's Etonian
career, to record his views on fagging, that venerable
institution, which is generally considered by Englishmen to have
contributed so largely towards their superiority to the rest
of mankind.  "When I was at Eton," he wrote, "fags thought
that all was fair in regard to their masters.  I had a master
who used to send me every morning to a farmhouse to get
him cream for his breakfast.  On my return I invariably
added a trifle of my milk to the cream and thickened my
milk with an infusion of my master's cream.  Thus, by the
light of that revenge, which Lord Bacon calls a 'rude sense
of justice,' I anticipated the watering process which has
been practised by so many public companies.  Sometimes
he would have jugged hare.  These occasions were my grand
opportunity, and, unknown to him, I used to pour out into
my own slop basin a portion of the savoury mess, and conceal
the deficit by an addition of pure water.  Fagging in fact,
is productive of more evil to the fag than the fagger.  The
former learns all the tricks and dodges of the slave."[<a id="chap02fn6text"></a><a href="#chap02fn6">6</a>]
</p>

<p>
Labouchere's matured judgment of Dr. Hawtrey was
expressed as follows:
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
Dr. Hawtrey was the headmaster when I was at Eton.  He was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P21"></a>21}</span>
an amiable and kindly man and a fine gentleman.  He probably
flogged about twenty boys every day, on an average.  He did
it with exquisite politeness, and, except on rare occasions, the
whole thing was a farce.  Four cuts were the ordinary application,
and ten cuts were never exceeded.  The proceedings took
place in public, and any boy who had a taste for the thing might
be a spectator.  If the victim flinched there was a howl of
execration.  Far from objecting to this, the doctor approved of it.
I remember once that a boy fell on his knees, and implored him
to spare him.  "I shall not condescend to flog you, but I leave
you to your young friends," said the doctor.  I happened to be
one of the young friends, and I remember aiding in kicking the
boy round the quadrangle for about half an hour.[<a id="chap02fn7text"></a><a href="#chap02fn7">7</a>]
</p>

The reflections of boys on the education to which they
have been subjected are remarkably interesting, because
they are so exceedingly rare.  We have Rousseau's criticism
of his upbringing, but it was penned when youth was behind,
and it is tinged with an affectation of intellectual
detachment and middle-aged self-consciousness which robs it of
the spontaneity which would be its only recommendation.
St. Augustine, when he wrote his confessions, knew far too
much to be able to write with simple sincerity of his foolish
youth.  Labouchere's early note-books, unlike these masterpieces,
possess the uncommon value of being youth's judgments
upon youth, written with all the hardy ingenuousness
of a clever boy, who was, besides being clever, extremely
young for his age.[<a id="chap02fn8text"></a><a href="#chap02fn8">8</a>]  About the period of his life which has
been described Labouchere wrote, at the age of twenty-one:
"I will give ... an outline of my life, and the different
courses that led to my discovery of early wisdom.  I went
through the usual numbers of schools, by which I learnt that
an English education, for the time and money that it
consumes, is the worst that the world has yet produced.  One
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P22"></a>22}</span>
clergyman alone of all my masters knew how to teach.  His
conduct was perfectly arbitrary, and he gave no reason for
it&mdash;while, in the several branches of learning, his pupils
either made rapid progress or left his house.  My acquaintance
with him was of short duration.  He insisted on my
teaching in an infant school on Sunday, or leaving his house&mdash;and
I foolishly preferred the latter.  I was then too young to
go to college, so I was transferred to a clergyman in Norfolk,
the very antipodes of my former master.  Here I amused
myself, and was flattered for a year or two, and then went to
the university."
</p>

<p>
In February, 1850, he went up to Trinity College,
Cambridge.  His tutor was Mr. Cooper.  In his note-book
describing the university period of his career Labouchere
wrote: "My father sent me to college, where, instead of
improving my mind (for manners, I own, must be bad to be
improved by such a place), I diligently attended the
race-course at Newmarket.  I had a general idea that here (at
the university) I should astonish the world by my talents&mdash;I
attended no lectures, as I considered myself too clever to
undergo the drudgery.  I considered myself&mdash;on what
grounds God knows&mdash;an orator and a poet.  I went to the
Debating Society and commenced a speech in favour of the
regicides, but, to my astonishment, entirely broke down.
To my equal astonishment, upon writing the first line of a
prize poem, I found it impossible to find a second.  To
become known in the university was my ambition&mdash;my short
cuts to fame had failed&mdash;it never entered my head to apply
myself really to study, so, in default of a better method, I
resolved to distinguish myself by my bets on horse-races.  I
diligently attended every meeting at Newmarket and spent the
evenings in a tavern, where the sporting students and sporting
tradesmen assembled to gamble.  At the end of two years I
had lost about £6000, and I owed to most of my sporting
friends....  Upon a dispute with the College authorities my
degree was deferred for two years, and I left the University."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P23"></a>23}</span>
</p>

<p>
So many incorrect versions of Labouchere's dispute with
the university have been given in various newspaper
biographical notices at different times that a short account of
what actually did happen will not be out of place here.
</p>

<p>
A court was held on April 2, 1852, at King's Lodge, to
hear a complaint brought by the proproctor, Mr. Barnard
Smith, against Henry Labouchere for having sent to various
university officers a printed paper, signed by himself,
imputing unfair conduct to Mr. Barnard Smith towards himself
whilst in the Senate House during an examination.
</p>

<p>
What happened at the Senate House is best told in
Labouchere's own words.  I quote the printed letter which
he sent to the university officers, and which was the cause
of his leaving Cambridge before he took his degree.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The undersigned went into the Senate House for the previous
Examination on Monday last, and had not been there long before
he was painfully surprised by the suspicions of one of the
proproctors, the Rev. Mr. Barnard Smith of St. Peter's College.
This gentleman, from the beginning of the Examination,
continued to watch the undersigned in so marked a manner as not
only to be noticed by himself but by other members of the
University, under examination, who sat near him.  The undersigned
felt much distressed at this special surveillance.  He had
done nothing to deserve suspicion of being likely to resort to any
unworthy practices in the Senate House, and the knowledge that
he was thus subject to what he felt to be little short of a direct
personal insult hindered his giving undivided attention to the
examination questions which he had to answer.
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding this discouragement, the undersigned sent
in his answers, which he has since been assured by one of the
Examiners were satisfactory....
</p>

<p>
On the day following (Tuesday), having nearly answered all
the questions, the undersigned was stopped by the
Rev. Mr. B. S. and charged with mal-practices
in the Examination, of which
he was not guilty.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
HENRY LABOUCHERE.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
After a short inquiry, during which it was ascertained
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P24"></a>24}</span>
that Labouchere had been guilty of writing the above letter,
the court delivered the following sentence: "The court being
of opinion that the charge has been fully proved, and that
the conduct of Mr. Labouchere has been highly reprehensible
and injurious to the character and discipline of the
University, sentences Henry Labouchere to be admonished and
suspended from his degree for two years."  In the course
of the inquiry, Labouchere defended himself with great
ability, though unsuccessfully.
</p>

<p>
I give his defence verbatim, as the detail with which he
gave it is the best possible account of the circumstances
which led up to his insubordinate act:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
The whole business seems so indefinite that it is almost impossible
to offer a defence.  I am convened before the Vice-Chancellor
for sending a printed notice to the Examiners and for bringing
a charge against Mr. Barnard Smith.  But what my copying or
not copying in the Senate House has to do with it, it is difficult
to say.  But, as my copying has been brought forward and is
supposed to bear on the subject, I am happy to have an opportunity
of disproving it.  Mr. Fenwick, on being asked, brought
forward 3 charges why I was sent out of the Senate House:
first, for having a paper concealed which I refused to give to the
Examiners; secondly, for asserting that the paper had nothing
to do with the Examination; and thirdly, for owning that it had.
Mr. Fenwick (who it appears had the direction of the case) made
no further charge.  Mr. Barnard Smith now brings an entirely
different charge, which is that I slipped a piece of paper into my
pocket, and that he imagines he saw me do so.  Why he didn't
stop me at the time he does not say.  Now all the Examiners
who had been examined here to-day, except Mr. Latham, say
that from my general conduct I was suspected of copying on
Monday.  Mr. Fenwick, however, is more particular, and says
that my position excited suspicion.  Mr. Woollaston says that
I did not appear to be occupied with the Examination.  So that
what my general conduct was is explained.  Having partly
finished 10 questions in the Scripture history, I, more as a rest
than anything else, wrote a note to a friend asking him how he
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P25"></a>25}</span>
had got on, and mentioned that I had just given a long answer
to the 10th question: I added, "I suppose the Shunamite woman
was the person whose son was struck with the sun."  While
reading this note to myself, I saw Mr. Barnard Smith coming
towards me; upon which I threw it away as far as possible; and
upon his asserting that he had seen a paper in my hands I said
that he had, but that I had no crib, nor had I in any way copied,
that it was a note having nothing to do with the Examination.
Not being in the habit of having my word questioned I saw no
reason for producing it.  Mr. Barnard Smith, however, thought
differently; and, as the Examiners agreed with him, upon demanding
its production I said that I had thrown it away, and it was
probably somewhere on the ground.  Having looked close by
and not perceived it, I told Mr. Fenwick that I didn't see it.
Mr. Fenwick, on this, ordered me to look for it, in a manner so
offensive, that I took no further trouble about the matter.  I then
told the Examiners that, if they wished to know what was in the
note, there was a question about the Shunamite woman, and
told them I had just finished the answer to that question.  I
then gave up my papers and left the Senate House.  The inference
I believe drawn from the last two charges is that I told a lie.
Upon this point any person may form his own opinion.  I
am asked whether I had a paper.  The paper is by that time
thrown away.  I answered that I had.  Had I denied it there
would have been no evidence, and the matter would probably
have dropped.
</p>

<p class="quote">
According to the Examiner I had first said the paper had
nothing to do with the Examination, and then, finding that the
paper is not produced, tell them that the paper had to do with
the Examination.  I simply stated what it contained and should
not have told a lie against myself.  The fact was, not seeing the
paper, and considering that Mr. Fenwick had ordered me to look
for it in rather an offensive way, I told them what it contained.
I had finished the Examination question at the time, and the
question in the note was not put in with any desire to know
whether it was right or wrong.  I simply put in that I supposed
it was right more for something to say than for anything else.
But I certainly did not consider it had anything to do with the
Examination in the way which Mr. Barnard Smith meant.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P26"></a>26}</span>
With respect to Mr. Barnard Smith's impression that I slipped
a piece of paper into my pocket, I wish that he had said so at
the time, that I might have disproved it.  I can only say now
that there is a sufficient internal evidence in my answers to show
that I didn't obtain assistance from any notes, as I had a general
knowledge of the subject, and confined myself to general facts.
After having been dismissed from the Senate House, and having,
in vain, challenged an investigation before the Vice-Chancellor,
as I understood the Examiners openly asserted that I had told a
lie, I sent a circular to them denying the charge.  I did this,
lest at any time hereafter, such an action should be brought to
my charge, and also that it had been unrefuted.  I have now
denied the charge, and for their individual opinion I care little.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The court asked, at this point, if Mr. Labouchere
deliberately wished these words to be recorded: he said "Yes"
and then went on with his defence:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
But, as in their office of Examiners they had unjustly asserted
that I told a lie, I did my duty in openly denying it.  I mean to
say that I sent this circular to the Examiners in their public
capacity and not as private individuals.  I sent it to justify
myself from a charge which I consider unjust, and upon which
I could not obtain an investigation.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The immediate reflection that presents itself to the mind
of any one who knew Labouchere well and who studies his
defence is that it is curious that it should have been over a
Scripture History paper that he was suspected of cribbing,
for, thanks to his early evangelical training and his innate
love of his Bible, Labouchere was almost phenomenally
proficient in Scripture knowledge.  He quoted the Bible,
and rarely incorrectly, on every occasion&mdash;in his parliamentary
speeches, in his journalistic articles, and in private
conversation&mdash;and he could, invariably, if questioned, give
chapter and verse for the verification of his quotation.
</p>

<p>
Two anecdotes have frequently been given in the press
about Labouchere's alleged cribbing at Cambridge.  I never
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P27"></a>27}</span>
heard him relate them himself, and they are probably legends
of the kind that are born in the journalist's brain whilst he
is racking it for copy in the shape of anecdotic detail.  The
first is that his academic career terminated abruptly because
he had made a bet with another undergraduate that he
would crib in his Little Go examination without being caught,
and that when caught he accused the examiner of being in
collusion with the other party to the bet.  The other is that
during the examination he was observed to be frequently
looking at something concealed beneath a sheet of blotting-paper.
On being asked to produce it, Labouchere refused.
But, when obliged to do so, it was found that the concealed
object was the photograph of a popular variety artiste, whose
bright eyes, he asserted, stimulated him to persevere in his
academic efforts.
</p>

<p>
There are, of course, any number of popular anecdotes of
Labouchere's university days.  A good one is the following.
On one occasion, having taken French leave to London, he
was unexpectedly confronted one morning in the Strand by
his father, who looked extremely annoyed to see the youth
there, when he imagined him to be occupied with his studies.
Henry's wits as usual were on the alert.  He returned his
father's cold greeting with a surprised stare.  "I beg your
pardon, sir," he said, "I think you have made a mistake.
I have not the honour of your acquaintance."  He pushed
by and was lost in the crowd.  Rapidly consulting his watch,
he found he could, by running, just catch a train for
Cambridge.  He did so, and what he had foreseen happened.
Mr. Labouchere, senior, after having accomplished the
business he was about, took the next train for Cambridge.  On
reaching the university he was ushered into his son's study,
where he found him absorbed in work.  He made no reference
to his rencontre in the Strand, being persuaded that it
must have been a hallucination.
</p>

<p>
Another story relates how he used to go about in a very
ragged gown.  One day the Master of Trinity, Whewell,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P28"></a>28}</span>
came across him and said, "Is that a proper academic
costume, Mr. Labouchere?"  "Really, sir, I must refer you
to my tailor," was the reply.
</p>

<p>
Labouchere continues in his note-book to describe, with
naïve minuteness of detail, his search for wisdom after he
left the university.  "With great liberality," he wrote, "my
father paid my debts, and advised my return home.  My
family ... was religious, and, finding my father's house
dull, I had accustomed myself to live at a tavern in Covent
Garden....  After remaining there for two or three weeks,
I used to return home, and leave it indefinite from where I
had come.  Until my leaving College and the payment of
my debts by my father, I had kept up an appearance of
respectability at home.  Now, however, I threw off all
restraint, and openly lived at my tavern for about two
months, during which I lost several hundred pounds at hells
and casinos."
</p>

<p>
The tavern which Labouchere frequented at this period
was far from being the haunt of vice which, with the gloomy
sternness of moralising youth, he wished to depict it.  It
was a species of night club, known as Evans', and was the
resort of all literary and artistic London.  It constantly
figures in Thackeray's novels and other books of the period
as a place of Bohemian rendezvous and the scene of a good
deal of rough-and-tumble jollity.  The house, of which it
formed the cellar, had once been the home of Sir Kenelm
Digby.  Above the tavern, or "Cave of Harmony" as
Thackeray called it, was the hotel in which Labouchere had
his rooms.  In later years, that is to say in the later fifties
and early sixties, the popularity of this place of conviviality
increased so much that it was found necessary to pull down
the little room where Labouchere used to listen every night
to the singing of more or less rowdy songs, and build on its
site a vast concert-room, with an annexe, consisting of a
comfortable hall, hung with theatrical portraits, where
conversation could be carried on.  There was a private
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P29"></a>29}</span>
supper-room in the grill, and this annexe became a popular
resort for men about town.  Some of the smartest talk in
London was to be heard at Evans', for it numbered among
its patrons such wits as Douglas Jerrold, Thackeray, Lionel
Lawson, Edmund Yates, Augustus Sala, Serjeant Ballantine,
John Leech, Serjeant Murphy&mdash;and Henry Labouchere.
The presiding spirit of the establishment was a great friend
of Labouchere's.  He acted as head waiter and was known
as Paddy Green.  He had commenced his career as a chorus-singer
at the Adelphi Theatre, and had won for himself in
all classes of society an immense popularity on account of
his courtesy and unfailing good-humour.  The prosperity of
Evans' only waned when the modern music-halls, where
women formed the larger part of the audience, became the
fashion.[<a id="chap02fn9text"></a><a href="#chap02fn9">9</a>]
</p>

<p>
From the superior point of view of the maturity of
twenty-one, Labouchere was inclined to survey, with an eye
of undue severity, the follies he committed at the age of
nineteen.  He wrote: "Whenever I entered into conversation
with any person, I introduced the subject of gambling,
and boasted of sums I had lost, which I appeared to consider,
instead of a disgrace, a subject on which I might justly
pride myself.  During this period I believe I had a general
wish to elevate myself to some higher position, as, while
passing my days and nights in profligacy, my chief study was
Dr. Johnson's <i>Life</i> and Lord Chesterfield's <i>Letters to his
Son</i>."  And again: "Inflated with conceit I imagined myself equal
to cope with all mankind.  In society I was awkward, and
therefore sought the society of my inferiors, while I
endeavoured to delude myself with the notion that I was a
species of socialist and that all men were equal.  Conversation,
properly so-called, I had none.  I could argue any
subject, but not converse&mdash;my manners were boorish&mdash;I had
never learnt to dance, so I seldom entered a ball-room, or if
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P30"></a>30}</span>
there, I pretended to despise the amusement, as I never
owned myself incapable of anything.  If I entered a
drawing-room, I either held myself aloof from the company, or I
argued some subject by the hour with my neighbour.  In
fact, in manners I was an <i>outré</i> specimen of an uncultivated
English young man&mdash;the most detestable yahoo in creation."
</p>

<p>
He continues: "From my tavern I was again rescued by
my father, who sent me abroad under the guidance of a
species of Mentor, who was, unfortunately, totally unfitted
for his task.  Three days after leaving England we arrived at
Wiesbaden, where there are public gaming tables.  Here I
felt myself at home, and the first day gained about £150.  My
Mentor, who was going to the hotel, offered to carry the
money I had won, and give it back to me the next day.
The next morning, however, on my asking for it, he refused
to return it unless I promised not to play while at Wiesbaden.
After my father had so often paid large sums for me, in
gratitude I ought to have yielded.  This, however, I refused
to do, but remained two months at Wiesbaden, while my
Mentor continued his travels.  At last it was agreed that I
should meet him at Paris, and there receive my money,
where, I need not add, in a few days it was spent."
</p>

<p>
Some of Mr. Labouchere's most interesting articles in
<i>Truth</i> in after years were the ones he was in the habit of
writing, when he was on his summer holiday, describing the
various resorts he visited, and he was always eager to recall
reminiscences of his boyhood when he found himself at a
place he had passed through in his youth.  He wrote from
Wiesbaden in 1890:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
German watering-places are dull places now that the gambling
at them has been abolished, and even those who did not play
at their tables have discovered this.  I am at Wiesbaden.  When
a jade repents of her ways and takes to propriety, she is little
given to overdo respectability.  So it is with this and other
examples of roulette and <i>trente et quarante</i>.  The respectability
of the Wiesbaden of to-day is positively oppressive.  Its devotion
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P31"></a>31}</span>
weighs upon the spirit.  I remember being here nearly
forty years ago.  I was then a lad travelling on the continent
with a bear-leader to enlarge my experience.  The bear-leader
and I never could quite agree what spot would prove the most
improving.  He wished to study still nature, I wished to study
human nature.  So, like Abram and Lot, we generally separated.
He betook himself to the Carpathian Mountains, I sojourned
here.  Wiesbaden was then cosmopolitan.  The tag-rag and
bobtail of all nations resorted to it, and, if all of them were not
quite <i>sans reproche</i>, they were all pleasant enough in their way.
There was a vague notion that, somewhere or other, there were
waters, but, where precisely they were, and what they cured,
very few knew.  The Kursaal was the centre of attraction, with
its roulette and its <i>trente et quarante</i>.[<a id="chap02fn10text"></a><a href="#chap02fn10">10</a>]
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
From Paris, Labouchere and his tutor returned to
England, and, after a month passed at Broome Hall with
occasional visits to his beloved Evans', it was arranged that
he should make a trip to South America, where his family
had had for many years very important commercial interests
and could give him some respectable introductions.  He
noted his impressions of his journey and arrival in America
in the most approved early Victorian guide-book manner,
but, in spite of an apparent effort to be, at the same time,
both stilted and elegant in style, his natural originality
peeps out here and there:
</p>

<p>
"On the 2nd of November, 1852, in the steam packet
<i>Orinoco</i>, I set sail, or rather set steam, from England.  For
the first ten days I remained in bed in all the agonies of
seasickness.  Some persons, particularly poets, find some
pleasure in a voyage, but I confess the <i>nil nisi pontus et aer</i>
is to me the most distasteful sight in creation, especially
when the <i>pontus</i> is rough.  The passengers were chiefly
Spaniards to Havana and Germans who were going to
'improve their prospects'&mdash;how I have no idea, but, from the
appearance of the gentlemen, they might have done so
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P32"></a>32}</span>
without becoming millionaires.  At nine we breakfasted, at
twelve lunched, at four dined, and at seven tea'd.  The rest
of the day was passed on deck.  Through storm and sunshine
the majority of the foreigners played at bull, a species
of marine quoits.  The ladies always knitted, and the
English read Dickens' <i>Household Words</i>.  In the evening
there was dancing.  There was an unfortunate devil of a
mulatto on board who offended the prejudices of the planters
by dancing with the white ladies.  'Why,' they said, 'that
fellow ought to be put up to auction unless anybody owns
him.'  In eating and these interesting diversions the day
passed.  The only incident that enlivened the voyage was,
that one night the Germans had an immense bowl of punch
brewed (I wish I had the recipe of that said punch, for a
better brew I never tasted) and sang sentimental songs.  One
German went round and informed the English they were
going to drink to <i>die</i> King of England, and, amid immense
applause, they bawled out 'Gott save <i>die</i> Queen.'  As the
punch got to their heads the songs became more sentimental.
A Bonn student seized the bowl, and wished to drink it to
the Fatherland, when another, who saw no reason why the
Bonn gentleman should consecrate the whole to his patriotism,
knocked him down.  This was the signal for a general row.
Some were sick, some sang, while a little Jew, who, before,
I had considered a steward, enlivened the scene by dancing
about in his night-shirt.  On coming up the next morning I
found the Bonn student offering generally to fight a duel with
any person who asserted he had misbehaved himself.  As no
one was valorous enough to do so, the student retired into
'bull.'  At St. Thomas we changed steamers and almost died
of heat.  The mulatto turned out very smart, which excited
the ire of one of the planters, who said, 'Look at that fellow
with a new coat, he ought to be diving about naked for
half-pence in the water.'  Decency, however, forbade the
mulatto taking the kindly meant advice.  Ten days after
leaving St. Thomas we arrived at Vera Cruz.  I ought to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P33"></a>33}</span>
have felt some sort of enthusiasm on first seeing America,
but a mosquito had stung me in the eye, so that I saw it
under difficulties; indeed, a person must possess a large
amount of enthusiasm to be aroused into any outward
display by the sandbanks and plaguish-looking shore of Vera
Cruz.  I had a letter to a merchant, who most hospitably
entertained me at his house, where I spent two days bathing
my eye in hot water.  On the third day, in company with
some friends, we left for Mexico in the diligence.  In a
European town we should have created some excitement
marching to the coach office, each armed with guns, swords,
and revolvers <i>ad libitum</i>.  Here, however, no one even
stopped to look at our martial appearance.  At the diligence
office we had a preliminary taste of the pleasure of travelling
in Mexico&mdash;travellers are only allowed 25 lbs. of luggage, and
as every person's portmanteau weighed twice as much, the
clerk refused to allow any to go.  While my companions were
haranguing inside I slipped my portmanteau, which was far
the largest, under the coachman's seat, and a dollar into his
hand.  During the journey I was looked upon as a villain
by my fellow-passengers, because each thought that, if I had
not existed, their traps would have taken the place of mine.
Their position was certainly uncomfortable&mdash;their sole
luggage was in their hands, consisting chiefly, as it appeared
to me, of tooth-brushes which they had taken out of their
trunks.  It was four in the evening when we started.  For
several leagues the carriage was pulled along a railway by
mules.  This comfortable method of travelling soon came to
an end, and, with it, all signs of a road; we were jolted along
a miserable path full of ruts, in part paved, or rather
unpaved, by the Americans during their invasion, to make the
road impassable.  Little did they know the Mexicans, as this
highroad from the chief seaport to the capital has never been
repaired to the present time.  Alison has given a glowing
description of the beauties of the scenery between Vera Cruz
and Mexico; it might have been Paradise, but, in that infernal
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P34"></a>34}</span>
diligence, knocking my head every minute against the top,
and holding on by both hands to the window, I was in no
mood to enjoy the scenery.  Fresh from Europe, I certainly
was astonished at the luxuriant tropical jungle, filled with
parrots and humming-birds instead of sparrows.  While my
eyes drank in this new scene, my nose drank in a succession
of pole-cats.  It is a journey of three days between Vera
Cruz and Mexico.  The first day and night is passed in a
tropical heat, after which commences the ascent to the
Grand Plateau of Mexico.  A rose smells as sweet under
another name, and, as it would be difficult to a European to
pronounce the names, I do not much regret forgetting where
we stopped the first night; the second was passed at Puebla di
los Angelos, a town remarkable for its superstition during the
rule of the Aztecs, and equally remarkable at present for its
intolerance.  When the cathedral was building, two angels
came down every night and doubled the work done during
the daytime by the mortal masons.  The cathedral is the
most beautiful in the country; every other house is a monastery
and a church.  At four we started again and jolted until
three.  Next morning, even under these difficulties, I could
not help admiring the scenery.  The only three snowy peaks
in Mexico were all distinctly visible, while the road wound
through mountains rising perpendicularly from the plain.
One we passed is called after Cortes' wife, and exactly
resembles in its outlines a giant asleep.  At the close of the
third day we reached Mexico.
</p>

<p>
"When the city was in the midst of a lake and approached
by causeways it might have excited the admiration of Cortes
and his army.  In the midst of a dry swamp it failed to excite
mine.  The advance of Cortes from the shore to the capital
was wonderful, but I really think it was to be preferred to the
diligence and unpaved road.  All sufferings have an end, and
mine ended in the diligence hotel.  I had imagined, from
travellers' accounts, that I should be lucky if I got a corner in
a barn with half a dozen mules, but I found myself sleeping
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P35"></a>35}</span>
in a comfortable room and dining at a table d'hôte in a most
distressingly civilised manner."
</p>

<p>
Labouchere does not think it necessary to his dignified
narrative to mention the fact that his tutor accompanied him
on this journey, but, upon a reference to his note-book, we
find that the long-suffering Mentor formed one of the party.
Labouchere is no less severe upon himself and his iniquities in
America than he was in England.  He wrote:
</p>

<p>
"We landed at Vera Cruz and proceeded to Mexico.  In
two months I lost all my money and £250 besides at cards.
To induce my Mentor to pay this sum I retired to a
neighbouring town and stated my intention to remain there until
he provided the money.  Here, in the <i>bena caliente</i>, in a small
inn, with no companion but the innkeeper, I remained for a
month.  Here I reconsidered my life and determined to
commence afresh.  I asked myself upon what ground I
rested my title to differ from the common race of fools.
Was I clever?  A scholar?  I had read a little.  On most
subjects I was ignorant&mdash;in society I could argue, but not
converse.  With a lady, with a duenna, with every person
in whose society I found myself, I introduced my sole
subject&mdash;gambling.  I told everybody that I had recently lost
£6000, which I imagined raised me in their opinion.  I could
not dance, and I shunned society.  I was conceited, and I
was unwilling to confess my ignorance of anything.  I was
an abominable and useless liar, as I was fond of relating
adventures of myself that had really never taken place.  I
was ready to make acquaintance with every person who
spoke to me.  Of music, drawing, and all the lighter arts I
knew absolutely nothing.  I was one thing and one alone&mdash;a
gambler&mdash;on that subject I could be eloquent; but I felt that
I could not consider myself superior to the generality of
mankind on this ground alone.  In playing even I failed, because,
though I theoretically discovered systems by which I was
likely to win, yet, in practice, I could command myself so
little that upon a slight loss I left all to chance."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P36"></a>36}</span>
</p>

<p>
The last entry in his note-book was made by Labouchere
in the seclusion of this little inn at Quotla di Amalpas, and it
ends abruptly.  Perhaps it was interrupted by the arrival of
the Mentor, after his receipt of the letter, the draft of which
is given further on.
</p>

<p>
"In my inn at Quotla di Amalpas I determined on reaching
the States to entirely give up gambling.  A gambler
requires to possess the greatest command over himself, in
which I entirely failed.  To be very reserved&mdash;a reserved
person is always supposed to be wiser than his neighbours.
To be engaged in as many intrigues as is possible with
ladies&mdash;nothing forms character so much as intrigues of this
description&mdash;<i>probatum est</i>.  To learn with a good
countenance to pay delicate compliments and to...."
</p>

<p>
In the flap of his note-book is the draft of the letter to his
tutor, referred to above, which must be quoted, as it is so
extremely characteristic of the man whose letters were ever,
to the very end of his life, the most frankly illuminative
documents as to the state of mind through which he might be
passing.  Incidentally, also, it cannot fail to suggest to the
reader a gleam of compassion for the problems and trials
which must have been the lot of its recipient.  Here it is:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
QUOTLA DI AMALPAS.
</p>

<p class="quote">
DEAR SIR,&mdash;I have just come back from Cuernava, where I
rode over the worst road even in Mexico.  Pray do not trouble
yourself to exercise your forbearance, or make excuses, as I can
assure you they are not wanted.  If you find the slightest
pleasure or amusement in writing to innkeepers not to give me money,
write to every one in the country, but do not give yourself the
trouble to tell me you have done so, as it is a matter of
unimportance to me.  My stopping in Mexico cannot now be helped, as
I certainly shall not leave before getting some money, and I
must then go to England to pay it.  I had intended not to gamble
in America, because of having to pay a double interest&mdash;but
man proposes and God disposes.  As R&mdash;&mdash; says, I made up a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P37"></a>37}</span>
story to avoid paying him.  I could not at present leave my
gambling debts unpaid, or he would be believed.  I shall borrow
some money here, and send to England (not to my father) for
some to pay it, and then go to England to pay it when it becomes
due.  It is a pity having to go back as I should have liked to see
a little more of America, but what is done is done, and cannot
be helped.&mdash;Yours truly,

CHAPTER III
<br><br>
TRAVELS AND DIPLOMACY
</h3>

<p class="t3">
(1853-1864)
</p>

<p>
Whether the Mentor resigned his job in despair
about the time his pupil was making prudent resolutions
in the seclusion of the little inn at Quotla di Amalpas,
or whether it was decided by the parental authority that
Labouchere might as well continue his search for wisdom in
Mexico by himself, is not certain; but it would seem that,
just about three months after his landing at Vera Cruz, he
parted company with all his English friends, and, with a
surprisingly small sum for such an adventure in his pocket,
rode off, and wandered for eighteen months all over the
country.  Then he returned to the capital, and fell in love
with a lady of the circus.  The published legends belonging
to this period of his career are legion.  The authority for
them appears to be almost always Mr. Joseph Hatton, who
was the first writer to produce a biographical sketch of the
editor of <i>Truth</i>.  He wrote it for <i>Harper's Magazine</i>, where
it formed part of a series which, in 1882, was published in
England under the title of <i>Journalistic London</i>.  According
to Hatton, Labouchere gave him certain details of his past
in an interview which took place at his house in Queen Anne's
Gate, so that Hatton's evidence, in so far as <i>viva voce</i>
reminiscences are reliable, is unimpeachable.[<a id="chap03fn1text"></a><a href="#chap03fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P39"></a>39}</span>
</p>

<p>
Labouchere told him that he travelled with the troupe to
which the lady he admired belonged, and got the job of
doorkeeper.  The circus was a popular one, but the crowds who
flocked to it were not all in a position to pay their entrance
with hard cash, so that he was authorised by the proprietors
to accept payment in kind&mdash;usually consisting of oranges or
small measures of maize.  A very similar story is related
about him as occurring a year or two later when he was
attaché at Washington, and is corroborated for me by Sir
Audley Gosling, to whom Labouchere related it one day in
his house in Old Palace Yard.  Sir Audley noticed hanging
on the wall a large playbill, and asked what it was.
</p>

<p>
"It's a funny story," replied Labouchere; "I will tell you
about it.  When attaché at Washington I was in the habit of
attending almost nightly a circus, standing often at the
artistes' entrance to the ring.  The proprietor had often
scowled at me, and one night asked me what I meant by
trespassing on sacred ground.  I told him I had formed an
honourable attachment for one of his ladies, and simply
stood in the passage to kiss the hem of her robe as she passed
by.  'Get out of this, you d&mdash;d loafer,' he said.  And I got
out.  A few months later I pointed out to my chief notices
in the New York press of a certain American sparkling wine
called, after the district where it was grown, 'Kitawber.'  I
told him I thought a report should be made on this new
vintage, and volunteered to draw up a report for the Foreign
Office.  He seemed surprised by my assiduity and very
unusual zeal (for I never did a stroke of work), and said:
'By all means go&mdash;that is a capital idea of yours.'  The
truth was my circus had removed to Kitawber and with it
my fair lady of the <i>haute école</i>, so thither I proceeded.  I
presented myself to the proprietor, my rude friend, and told
him I wished for an engagement with his troupe without
salary.  He asked me what my line was, and I told him
standing jumps.  Some obstacles were placed in the ring,
over which I jumped with great success, and my name
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P40"></a>40}</span>
figures on the playbill you see hanging there as the 'Bounding
Buck of Babylon.'  I wore pink tights, with a fillet round my
head.  My adorable one said I looked a dear."
</p>

<p>
It is more probable that these two stories are different
versions of one and the same adventure than that he twice
followed a travelling circus.  No doubt, in recounting the
tale, he confused the chronology.
</p>

<p>
It would appear that the well-known story of his six
months' residence among the Chippeway Indians, usually
related as an incident occurring in the off moments of his
diplomatic career, really took place towards the end of 1853.
Joseph Hatton, without mentioning any dates, relates it as
follows: "By and by he tired of this occupation (<i>i.e.</i>
travelling with the circus), and went to the United States.
He found himself at St. Paul, which was then only a cluster
of houses.  Here he met a party of Chippeway Indians going
back to their homes.  He went with them and lived with
them for six months, hunting buffalo, joining in their work
and sports, playing cards for wampum necklaces, and living
what to Joaquin Miller would have been a poem in so many
stanzas, but which, to the more prosaic Englishman, was just
seeing life and passing away the time."  More than half a
century later, when Mr. Labouchere was living at Pope's
villa, he invited all the Indian chiefs and their families, who
were at that time taking part in Buffalo Bill's Show called
"The Wild West," to spend a Sunday with him at Twickenham.
They accepted the invitation, and arrived betimes in
the morning.  Mrs. T. P. O'Connor, who was a visitor at the
villa on the occasion, gives a graphic account of
Mr. Labouchere's recognition, in the person of one of the
Chippeways, of the son of one of the nomadic friends of his early
youth.  She goes on to tell the story of Mr. Labouchere's
adventures with the Indians, as she had often heard him tell it.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
Nearly sixty years ago, [she says], Henry Labouchere, then
an adventurous lad, made a journey in the west of America.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P41"></a>41}</span>
Minneapolis was at that time called St. Anthony's Palls, and
while he was there a far-seeing young chemist begged him to
buy the land on which Minneapolis stands&mdash;it was to be sold for
a very small sum, now it is worth many millions.  He travelled
still farther west with the Chippeways, who were going to their
hunting fields.  The great chief, Hole in Heaven, was very friendly
with him, and he camped in one of their wigwams for six weeks,
the sister of the chief being assigned to wait upon him.  She
cooked game to perfection, roasting wild birds in clay and larger
game before a fire.  The game in those days was very plentiful
and tame, not having found out man to be their natural enemy.
Sometimes prairie chickens came near enough to be knocked on
the head, and great herds of buffalos still ranged the plains.
The Indians often killed a buffalo, but Mr. Labouchere was not
lucky enough to get one for himself.  He saw an Indian war-dance,
but discreetly, from a slit in the door of his wigwam, as Hole
in Heaven said that, friendly as they were, at this sacred rite a
white face might infuriate them even to the use of the tomahawk.
Mr. Labouchere lingered among these American gentlemen until
the last steamer had departed from Fond du Lac, so he was
obliged to travel in a canoe until he reached the eastern end of
the lake.[<a id="chap03fn2text"></a><a href="#chap03fn2">2</a>]
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
After his experiences in the Wild West, Labouchere made
New York his quarters for some time, and occupied himself
with a careful study of the institutions, political and
otherwise, of the American nation, for which he acquired at this
period of his life a profound and lasting admiration.  In 1883
he was writing to Mr. Joseph Chamberlain on the subject of
Radical policy, and he said in the course of his letter: "I was
caught young and sent to America; there I imbibed the
political views of the country, so that my Radicalism is not
a joke, but perfectly earnest.  My opinions of most of the
institutions of this country is that of Americans&mdash;that they
are utterly absurd and ridiculous."[<a id="chap03fn3text"></a><a href="#chap03fn3">3</a>]  He constantly throughout
his career drew upon his youthful reminiscences of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P42"></a>42}</span>
America to point a moral or draw a comparison, almost
invariably favourable to the transatlantic people.  In a
famous article which he wrote in 1884, to demonstrate to the
public the wide divergency existing at that time between
Whig and Radical principles, while discussing the financial
relations of the Crown with the country, he said:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
The President of the United States regards himself as
generously treated with a salary of £10,000 per annum.  We give
half this sum to a nobleman who condescends to walk before the
Chief of the State on ceremonial occasions with a coloured stick
in his hand; and we spend more than five times this sum in
keeping a yacht in commission and repair on which our sovereign
steps two or three times in twenty years!
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
In the same article he compared the English system of
education with the American:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
If M * * * * wishes to learn what our schools ought to be, let
him go to the State of Illinois.  A child there enters school at the
age of six.  Each school is divided into ten grades; at the end of
each year there is an examination, and a child goes up one or more
grades according to his proficiency.  A lad going through all the
grades acquires an excellent liberal education; if he passes through
the "high school" he is, by a very long degree, the educational
superior of the majority of our youths who have spent years at
Eton or at Harrow.  All this does not cost his parents one cent.
Rich and poor alike send their children to the public schools,
and thus all class prejudice is early stamped out of the American
breast.  Another advantage of these schools is that boys and girls
are taught together.  The girls thus learn early how to take care
of themselves, and the boys' manners are softened.  When grown
up, boys and girls are not kept apart as though they were each
other's natural enemies, nor are there any ill effects from their
associating together.  If some marry, the relations of those who
do not are those of brothers and sisters.  The Duke of Wellington
is reported to have said that Waterloo was won in the Eton
playing fields.  Not only was the Union maintained in many
battlefields, but America has become the most forward nation
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P43"></a>43}</span>
in the world owing to her schools.  How pitiably small and
narrow does our school system appear in comparison with theirs!
Why cannot we do what has been done in America?  Why?
Because the land is too full of men ... ignorant, servile, and
aware that their only chance of succeeding in life is to perpetuate
class distinctions, and to deprive the vast majority of their
fellow-citizens of the possibility of competing with them by depriving
them of the blessings of any real education.  Which would be
to the greater advantage of the country, a Church Establishment
such as ours, or a school establishment such as that of Illinois?
What Radical entertains a doubt?  If so, why do not we at once
substitute the one for the other?[<a id="chap03fn4text"></a><a href="#chap03fn4">4</a>]
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
In his letters to the <i>Daily News</i> during the autumn and
winter of 1870 and 1871, he wrote from Paris commenting on
the behaviour of the English and American officials of the
Diplomatic Corps who remained in Paris during the siege.
"Diplomats," he wrote on September 28th, "are little better
than old women when they have to act in an emergency.
Were it not for Mr. Washburne, who was brought up in the
rough-and-ready life of the Far West, instead of serving an
apprenticeship in Courts and Government offices, those who
are still here would be perfectly helpless.  They come to him
at all moments, and although he cannot speak French, for all
practical purposes, he is worth more than all his colleagues
put together."  In another letter he gives an amusing picture
of the worried English chargé d'affaires, immersed in official
trivialities: "A singular remonstrance has been received at
the British Embassy.  In the Rue de Chaillot resides a
celebrated English courtesan, called Cora Pearl, and above her
house floats the English flag.  The inhabitants of the street
request the Ambassador of England, 'a country, the purity
and decency of whose manners is well known,' to cause this
bit of bunting, which is a scandal in their eyes, to be hauled
down.  I left Mr. Wodehouse consulting the text-writers
upon international law, in order to discover a precedent for
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P44"></a>44}</span>
the case."  It contrasts sharply enough with the glimpse he
gives his readers of the American Embassy.  "I passed the
afternoon," he wrote on November 15th, "greedily devouring
the news at the American Legation.  It was a curious
sight&mdash;the Chancellerie was crowded with people engaged in the
same occupation.  There were several French journalists,
opening their eyes very wide, under the impression that this
would enable them to understand English.  A Secretary of
Legation was sitting at a table giving audiences to unnumbered
ladies who wished to know how they could leave Paris;
or, if this was impossible, how they could draw on their
bankers in New York.  Mr. Washburne walked about
cheerily shaking every one by the hand, and telling them to
make themselves at home.  How different American diplomatists
are to the prim old women who represent us abroad,
with a staff of half a dozen dandies helping each other to do
nothing, who have been taught to regard all who are not of
the craft as their natural enemies."  Yet another quotation
from Labouchere's journalistic correspondence, illustrating
his predilection for things American: "The ambulance which
is considered the best is the American.  The wounded are
under canvas, the tents are not cold, and yet the ventilation
is admirable.  The American surgeons are far more skilful
in the treatment of gunshot wounds than their French
colleagues.  Instead of amputation they practise resection
of the bone.  It is the dream of every French soldier, if he is
wounded, to be taken to this ambulance.  They seem to be
under the impression that, even if their legs are shot off, the
skill of the Esculapii of the United States will make them
grow again.  Be this as it may, a person might be worse off
than stretched on a bed with a slight wound under the tents
of the Far West.  The French have a notion that, go where
you may, to the top of a pyramid or to the top of Mont Blanc,
you are sure to meet an Englishman reading a newspaper; in
my experience of the world, the American girl is far more
inevitable than the Britisher; and, of course, under the stars
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P45"></a>45}</span>
and stripes which wave over the American tents, she is to be
found, tending the sick, and, when there is nothing more to
be got for them, patiently reading to them or playing at
cards with them.  I have a great weakness for the American
girl; she always puts her heart in what she is about.  When
she flirts she does it conscientiously, and when she nurses a
most uninviting-looking Zouave, or Franc-tireur, she does it
equally conscientiously; besides, as a rule, she is pretty, a
gift of nature which I am very far from undervaluing."
</p>

<p>
To resume our narrative.  At home the parental and
avuncular authorities had been at work, puzzling as to what
career would best suit the young searcher for wisdom, the
irrepressible Eton blood&mdash;the baby of the preparatory school,
who, without his milk teeth, was able to confound the
ruffians of the cane and their assistants&mdash;the undaunted enemy
of university dons and pedagogues.  Finally, it was decided
that the diplomatic service would be, at any rate for a time,
the best safety-valve for the inquisitive youth.  Henry
Labouchere was on one of his unconventional tours in his
beloved Wild West when he heard of his first diplomatic
appointment.  He was appointed attaché at Washington on
July 16, 1854.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Crampton had been Minister at Washington since
1852, and, at the time of Labouchere taking up his duties at
the Legation, Lord Elgin, then Governor of Canada, was
on a special mission to Washington.  Mr. Crampton had
not succeeded in making himself at all agreeable to the
American statesmen, and during the Crimean War he had
nearly caused a rupture between Great Britain and the
United States over the question of recruiting.  The exigencies
of war had brought about the reprehensible practice of
raising various foreign corps and pressing them&mdash;or crimping
them&mdash;into the British service.  Crampton very actively
forwarded the schemes of his Government by encouraging
the recruiting of soldiers within the territories of the United
States.  It was not, however, until 1856 that the President
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P46"></a>46}</span>
of the United States came to a determination to discontinue
official intercourse with him on account of the recruiting
question.  This necessitated his removal from Washington,
and the feeling against him in the United States was so strong
that diplomatic relations were not renewed with Great
Britain for more than six months.[<a id="chap03fn5text"></a><a href="#chap03fn5">5</a>]  There is no evidence of
any kind to support the statements that have appeared from
time to time in the press, to the effect that Henry Labouchere
was involved in the crimping business.  During the time he
spent at Washington he seems to have been an assiduous
worker&mdash;to which the number of despatches in his handwriting
preserved in the archives of the Record Office bear
witness.
</p>

<p>
He related in <i>Truth</i>, some years later, how his energy
received a check at the very outset of his career.  "When
I joined the diplomatic service," he said, "I was sent as
attaché to a legation where a cynic was the minister.  New
brooms sweep clean.  Every morning I appeared, eager to be
employed, a sort of besom tied up in red tape.  Said the
cynic to me: 'If you fancy that you are likely to get on in the
service by hard work, you will soon discover your error; far
better will it be for you if you can prove that some relation of
yours is the sixteenth cousin of the porter at the Foreign
Office.'  It was not long before I discovered that the cynic
was right."
</p>

<p>
It was the fate of Henry Labouchere, wherever he went,
to create an atmosphere of unconventionality, which formed
a fitting background for the numberless stories which seem
still to collect and grow round his name as time goes on.
During one of Mr. Crampton's absences from the Legation,
he had an opportunity of exercising the official reserve and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P47"></a>47}</span>
discretion for which the English diplomats have always been
so famous.  An American citizen called one morning to see
Mr. Crampton.  "I want to see the boss," he said.  "You
can't&mdash;he is out," replied Labouchere.  "But you can see
me."  "You are no good," replied the American.  "I must
see the boss.  I'll wait."  "Very well," calmly said the
attaché, and went on with his letter-writing.  The visitor
sat down and waited for a considerable time.  At last he
said: "I've been fooling round here two hours; has the chief
come in yet?"&mdash;"No; you will see him drive up to the front
door when he returns."&mdash;"How long do you reckon he will
be before he comes?"  "Well," said Labouchere, "he went
to Canada yesterday; I should say he'll be here in about six
weeks."
</p>

<p>
In spite of all his good resolutions Labouchere was still a
gambler, and once found himself in what might have been an
awkward scrape owing to this propensity.  All who knew
him at all intimately must often have heard him tell the
following episode, which I will relate as nearly as possible in
his own words: "While I was attaché at Washington I was
sent by the minister to look after some Irish patriots at
Boston.  I took up my residence at a small hotel, and wrote
down an imaginary name in the hotel book as mine.  In the
evening I went to a gambling establishment, where I lost
all the money I had with me except half a dollar.  Then I
went to bed, satisfied with my prowess.  The next morning
the bailiffs seized on the hotel for debt, and all the guests
were requested to pay their bills and to take away their
luggage.  I could not pay mine, and so I could not take away
my luggage.  All that I could do was to write to Washington
for a remittance, and to wait two days for its arrival.  The
first day I walked about, and spent my half dollar on food.
It was summer, so I slept on a bench on the common, and
in the morning went to the bay to wash myself.  I felt
independent of all the cares and troubles of civilisation.
But I had nothing with which to buy myself a breakfast.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P48"></a>48}</span>
I grew hungry and, towards evening, more hungry still, so
much so that I entered a restaurant and ordered dinner,
without any clear idea how I was to pay for it, except by
leaving my coat in pledge.  In those days Boston restaurants
were mostly in cellars, and there was a bar near the
door, where the proprietor sat to receive payment.  As I
ate my dinner I observed that all the waiters, who were
Irishmen, were continually staring at me, and evidently
speaking of me to each other.  A guilty conscience made me
think that this was because I had an impecunious look, and
that they were discussing whether my clothes would cover
my bill.  At last one of them approached me, and said: "I
beg your pardon, sir; are you the patriot Meagher?"  Now
this patriot was a gentleman who had aided Smith O'Brien
in his Irish rising, had been sent to Australia, and had
escaped thence to the United States.  It was my business to
look after patriots, so I put my finger before my lips, and
said: "Hush!" while I cast up my eyes to the ceiling as
though I saw a vision of Erin beckoning to me.  It was felt
at once that I was Meagher.  The choicest viands were
placed before me, and most excellent wine.  When I had
done justice to all the good things I approached the bar and
asked boldly for my bill.  The proprietor, also an Irishman
said: "From a man like you, who has suffered in the good
cause, I can take no money; allow a brother patriot to shake
you by the hand."  I allowed him.  I further allowed all the
waiters to shake hands with me, and stalked forth with the
stern, resolved, but somewhat condescendingly dismal air
which I have seen assumed by patriots in exile.  Again I
slept on the common, again I washed in the bay.  Then I
went to the post office, found a letter for me from
Washington with some money in it, and breakfasted."
</p>

<p>
Another anecdote Labouchere was fond of recalling about
his Washington days was the following: Having planned a
little holiday excursion, he found at the Chancellerie a letter
awaiting him, addressed in the well-known handwriting of his
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P49"></a>49}</span>
chief.  Shrewdly suspecting that the instructions it contained
would render his holiday impossible, he put the letter
unopened in his coat-tail pocket, and carried out with great
satisfaction to himself his holiday intentions.  Then he
opened his letter, and found that his suspicions of its contents
had been very well founded.  He wrote a nice letter of
apology to his chief, beginning, "Your letter has followed me
here," which was, after all, nothing but the simple truth!
</p>

<p>
"It is a funny thing," Labouchere would often say,
speaking of treaties and diplomatic negotiations in general,
"to notice on what small matters success or the reverse is
dependent"; and he would then relate how, when he was
attaché at Washington, he went down with the British
Minister to a small inn at Virginia to meet Mr. Marcy, the
Secretary of State for the United States, for the purpose of
discussing a reciprocity treaty between Canada and the
United States.  Mr. Marcy, in general the most genial and
agreeable of men, was as cross as a bear, and would agree to
nothing.  Labouchere asked the secretary to tell him, in
confidence, what was the matter with his chief.  The secretary
replied: "He is not getting his rubber of whist."  After
that the British Minister proposed a rubber of whist every
night, which he invariably lost.  Mr. Marcy was immensely
pleased at beating the Britishers at, what he called
"their own game," and his good humour returned.  "Every
morning," Labouchere related, "when the details of the
treaty were being discussed, we had our revenge, and scored
a few points for Canada."
</p>

<p>
Labouchere was transferred to the Legation at Munich in
December, 1855.  "Old King Louis was then alive," he
wrote thirty years later, "although he had been deposed for
making a fool of himself over Lola Montes.  I used frequently
to meet him in the streets, when he always stopped me to
ask how Queen Victoria was.  I had at last respectfully
to tell him that Her Majesty was not in the habit of writing
to me every day respecting her health."
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P50"></a>50}</span>
</p>

<p>
From Munich he went to Stockholm in 1857.  I cannot
resist quoting in full his account of the duel he fought
while at Stockholm with the Austrian chargé d'affaires, it is
so extremely characteristic of him both in spirit and style.
</p>

<p>
At Stockholm "I found favour with my superiors for
the curious reason that I challenged an Austrian chargé
d'affaires.  Never was there a more absurd affair.  There was
an Englishman who had been challenged by a Swede, whom
he declined to fight.  A few days later the Englishman went
with my Minister to a box in the theatre.  The next day at
a club the Austrian chargé d'affaires said before me and
others that Englishmen had odd ideas of honour, and more
particularly English Ministers.  I replied that Englishmen
were not so silly as to fight duels, and that the English
Minister was not a dishonourable man for appearing in a theatre
with his countrymen.  As it was generally felt that I ought
to challenge this Austrian, I 'put myself in the hands' of the
French and Prussian Ministers.  A few hours later my
seconds came to me.  I expected that they were going to tell
me that the Austrian had apologised.  Not at all.  With a
cheerful smile they observed: 'It is arranged for to-morrow
morning&mdash;pistols.'  At seven o'clock A.M. they reappeared.
Their countenances were downcast.  'I have lost the mould
for the bullets of my duelling pistols,' observed the Prussian,
'and we have had to borrow a pair of pistols, for whose
accuracy of aim I cannot vouch.'  This inwardly rejoiced
me, but, of course, I pretended to share in the regret of my
seconds.  We sat down to an early breakfast.  'You are
young, I am old,' said the Frenchman; 'would that I could
take your place.'  I wished it as sincerely as he did, but I
tried to assume an air of rather liking my position, and I
grinned a ghastly grin.  Then we started for the park.  The
opposition had not arrived; but there was a surgeon, who had
been kindly requested to attend by my sympathising friends.
'An accident may happen,' observed the Prussian; 'do
you wish to confide to me any dispositions that you may
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P51"></a>51}</span>
desire to be carried out after&mdash;&mdash;?' and he sighed in a horribly
suggestive manner.  'No,' I said; I had nothing particular
to confide; and as I looked at the surgeon I thought what an
idiot I was to make myself the target for an Austrian to aim
at, in order to establish the principle that Englishmen have a
perfect right to decline to fight duels.  There was a want of
logic about the entire proceeding that went to my heart.
To be killed is bad enough, but to be killed paradoxically is
still worse.  Soon the Austrian and his seconds appeared.
I never felt more dismal in my life.  The Austrian stood
apart; I stood apart.  The surgeon already eyed me as a
'subject.'  The seconds consulted; then the Frenchman
stepped out twelve paces.  He had very short legs, and they
seemed to me shorter than ever.  After this came the loading
of the pistols.  Sometimes, I thought, seconds do not put in
the bullets; this comforted me, but only for a moment, for
the bullets were rammed down with cheerful energy.  By
this time we had been placed facing each other.  A pistol was
given to each of us.  'I am to give the signal,' said the
Prussian; 'I shall count one, two, three, and then at the
word fire, you will both fire.  Gentlemen, are you ready?'  We
both nodded.  'One, two, three, fire!' and both our
pistols went off.  No harm had been done.  I felt considerably
relieved when to my horror the Frenchman stepped up to
me, and said: 'I think that I ought to demand a second shot
for you, but mind, if nothing occurs again, I shall not allow a
third shot.'  'Ye&mdash;es,' I said; so we had a second shot, with
the same result.  Knowing that my Frenchman was a man of
his word, I felt now that I might at no risk to myself display
my valour, so I demanded a third shot.  The seconds consulted
together; for a moment I feared that they were going to grant
my request, and I was greatly relieved when they informed
me that they considered that two shots were amply sufficient.
I was delighted, but I pretended to be most unhappy, and
religiously kept up the farce of being an aggrieved person."[<a id="chap03fn6text"></a><a href="#chap03fn6">6</a>]

</p>

<p>
He was at Frankfort and St. Petersburg between November,
1858, and the summer of 1860.  While he was at Frankfort
he made the acquaintance of Bismarck, who was the
Prussian representative at the restored Diet of Frankfort.
Labouchere had a constitutional dislike of the German
people, with the exception of the great Chancellor.  He wrote
some years later: "The only Prussian I ever knew who was
an agreeable man was Bismarck.  All others with whom I
have been thrown&mdash;and I have lived for years in Germany&mdash;were
proud as Scotchmen, cold as New Englanders, and
touchy as only Prussians can be.  I once had a friend among
them.  His name was Buckenbrock.  I inadvertently called
him Butterbrod.  We have never spoken since!"  Bismarck
was an eminently social person, fond of drinking and smoking,
and many a time did Labouchere listen to his jovial loud-toned
talk in the cafés at Frankfort.  "Bismarck," he wrote
in later life, "used to pass entire nights drinking beer in a
garden overlooking the Main.  In the morning after a night
passed in beer-drinking he would write his despatches, then
issue forth on a white horse for a ride, and on his return,
attend the Diet, of which he was a member."[<a id="chap03fn7text"></a><a href="#chap03fn7">7</a>]  It is interesting
to note how very similar were the judgments of these
two exceedingly different characters upon the subject of
diplomacy and its aspects of absurdity and pomposity.
Bismarck wrote from Frankfort: "Frankfort is hideously
tiresome.  The people here worry themselves about the
merest rubbish, and these diplomatists with their pompous
peddling already appear to me a good deal more ridiculous
than a member of the second chamber in all the pride of his
lofty station.  Unless external accidents should accrue,
... I know exactly how much we shall effect in one, two, or five
years from the present time, and will engage to do it all
myself within four-and-twenty hours, if the others will only be
truthful and sensible throughout one single day.  I never
doubted that, one and all, these gentlemen prepared their
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P53"></a>53}</span>
dishes <i>à l'eau</i>, but such thin, mawkish water soup as this,
devoid of the least symptom of richness, positively astounds
me.  Send me your village schoolmaster or road inspector,
clean washed and combed; they will make just as good
diplomatists as these."[<a id="chap03fn8text"></a><a href="#chap03fn8">8</a>]  Of diplomatic literature Bismarck
observed: "For the most part it is nothing but paper and
ink.  If you wanted to utilise it for historical purposes, you
could not get anything worth having out of it.  I believe it is
the rule to allow historians to consult the F. O. Archives at
the expiration of thirty years (after date of despatches, etc.).
They might be permitted to examine them much sooner, for
the despatches and letters, when they contain any information
at all, are quite unintelligible to those unacquainted
with the persons and relations treated of in them."[<a id="chap03fn9text"></a><a href="#chap03fn9">9</a>]
Labouchere wrote in 1889: "If all Foreign Office telegrams were
published, they would be curious reading.  Years ago I was
an attaché at Stockholm.  The present Queen, then Duchess
of Ostrogotha, had a baby, and a telegram came from the
Foreign Office desiring that Her Majesty's congratulations
should be offered, and that she should be informed how the
mother and child were.  The Minister was away, so off I
went to the Palace to convey the message and to inquire
about the health of the pair.  A solemn gentleman received
me.  I informed him of my orders, and requested him to say
what I was to reply.  "Her Royal Highness," he replied,
"is as well as can be expected, but His Royal Highness is
suffering a little internally, and it is thought that this is due
to the milk of the wet nurse having been slightly sour
yesterday evening."  I telegraphed this to the Foreign
Office."[<a id="chap03fn10text"></a><a href="#chap03fn10">10</a>]
</p>

<p>
In a speech he made in the House of Commons,[<a id="chap03fn11text"></a><a href="#chap03fn11">11</a>] protesting
against a sum of nearly £50,000 being voted for the
salaries and expenses of the department for Her Majesty's
Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Labouchere said,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P54"></a>54}</span>
referring in particular to Foreign Office messengers, that
very often these gentlemen were sent abroad, at a very large
cost to the country, for no practical object whatever.  They
went on a certain route, and the business was made up for
them as they went.  He had had the honour to serve at one
time under Sir Henry Bulwer at Constantinople.  Now Sir
Henry Bulwer was always ill; and on one occasion he
remembered making a calculation that a box of pills Sir Henry
was anxious to obtain, and which was sent out by a Foreign
Office messenger, cost the country from £200 to £300.
Probably the pills did Sir Henry good, and pills were much
more useful than a good deal of the stuff sent out by the
Foreign Office.  He went on to tell the House that he had
himself been in the diplomatic service for ten years, and he
had spent a great deal of his time in ciphering and deciphering
telegrams, and that he could not remember half a dozen of
them that any man, woman, or child in the whole world
would have taken any trouble to decipher for any information
that could have been derived from them.
</p>

<p>
Labouchere used always to say that, while he was
attaché at Frankfort, he spent most of his time at Wiesbaden,
Homburg, or Baden, because he found the Diet of the
German Confederation "rather a dull sort of affair."  He
managed, however, to make a great many very staunch
friends at this period of his life.  One of these was the old
Duchess of Cambridge.  He was a frequent visitor at the
Schloss of Ruppenheim, which was the summer meeting-place
of the main stock and branches of the Hesses.  The
old Duchess made a great fuss over him, for he could speak
the German of Hanover so well that she could understand his
banter and enjoy it.  His popularity at Frankfort, according
to his own account, rested on a very simple basis.  Great
Britain was represented at the Diet by Sir Alexander Malet,
one of the most popular chiefs to be found in the Service.
"But I was even more appreciated than my chief," he would
relate, "and this is why.  Sometimes there was a ball at the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P55"></a>55}</span>
Court, which we were expected to attend.  At my first ball
supper I found myself next to a grandee, gorgeous in stars
and ribbons.  The servant came to pour out champagne.
I shook my head, for I detest champagne.  The grandee
nudged me, and said, 'Let him pour it out.'  This I did,
and he explained to me that our host never gave his guests
more than one glass, 'So you see, if I drink yours, I shall
have two.'  After this there used to be quite a struggle to
sit near me at Court suppers."
</p>

<p>
Yet another ridiculous reminiscence of the Court of
Darmstadt, dating from his attaché days at Frankfort.  Sir
Alexander Malet was fond of whist, and it was felt, said
Labouchere, that an English diplomatist could not be
expected to play the game for less than florin points.  Such
stakes, however, the fortune of no Darmstadt nobleman could
stand.  A sort of joint purse was therefore formed, which
was entrusted to the three best players of the grand-ducal
Court, and these champions encountered the Englishman.
"It was amusing," Labouchere would relate, "to watch the
anxiety depicted on all countenances: when the Minister won
all was gloom; when he lost, counts and countesses, barons
and baronesses, skipped about in high glee, like the hills of
the Psalmist."
</p>

<p>
Bismarck was Ambassador at St. Petersburg during the
year that Labouchere was there as attaché in 1860, so it is
very probable that he continued to imbibe wisdom from
listening to the conversation of the great German, for whose
powers of statecraft he always expressed the warmest
admiration.  The following amusing episode occurred during
his year at St. Petersburg.  He was in love with the wife of
one of the gentlemen about the Court.  So was a tall, smart
young Frenchman.  Labouchere was desperately jealous of
his rival, but could think of no means of outwitting him.
At a Court function they were both standing near the object
of their admiration, the Frenchman making, it seemed to
Labouchere, marked advances in the lady's favour.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P56"></a>56}</span>
However he was soon called away for some reason or another.
Labouchere, in his eagerness to seize the opportunity and
advance his own suit, inadvertently tipped his cup of black
coffee over the lady's magnificent yellow satin train.  He
was in despair, but, seeing that she had not yet perceived the
tragedy, he slipped the cup and saucer into his tail-coat
pocket, and then, with an air of commiseration, drew her
attention to the ruined gown.  "Who did it?" she exclaimed
furiously.  Labouchere put his finger to his lips, at the same
time looking significantly at the form of his rival, at that
moment disappearing through the doorway.  "I know who
did it," he said, "but wild horses would not induce me to
tell you."  Of course, the lady had followed the direction of
his glance.  She exclaimed: "That ruffian, I will never speak
to him again as long as I live!"  History does not relate how
the adventure proceeded for the handsome Frenchman's rival.
</p>

<p>
Labouchere did not think much of the Russians.  He
used to say that they were like monkeys, eager to copy the
manners of civilised Europe, but that the copy they succeeded
in producing was a daub and not a picture, because they
always exaggerated their originals.  When they were polite,
they were too polite; when they were copying Frenchmen,
they were too much like dancing masters; and when they
were copying Englishmen they were too much like grooms.
He had an amusing account to give of a visit he once paid
to a Russian country house.  "Card-playing, eating and
drinking&mdash;and more especially the latter," he related&mdash;"went
on all day and nearly all night.  I never could understand
where my bedroom was, for the excellent reason, as I
at length discovered, that I hadn't one.  At a late hour I
saw several of the guests heaping up in corners cushions
which they had taken from sofas, to serve as beds, so I
followed their example.  When I woke up in the morning
I could not see any apparatus to wash in, so I filled a china
bowl with water, and, having dried myself with a tablecloth
which I found in an adjoining room, I dressed."  He
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P57"></a>57}</span>
gave a charming thumb-nail sketch of a Russian drawing-room,
à propos of a visit of Mr. Augustus Lumley to the
Russian capital.  Mr. Lumley was a famous cotillon leader.
"I was at St. Petersburg when Mr. Lumley arrived on a
visit.  He was solemnly introduced to the Russian leader of
cotillons, who is invariably an officer of distinction, as a
colleague.  It was like the meeting between two famous
generals, and reminded me of the pictures of Wellington and
Blücher on the field of Waterloo.  It took place at a ball,
and the Russian, with chivalrous courtesy, offered to surrender
to his English colleague the direction of the cotillon."
</p>

<p>
The Emperor of Russia[<a id="chap03fn12text"></a><a href="#chap03fn12">12</a>] once stood beside Henry
Labouchere whilst he was playing at écarté to watch his
game.  The occasion was a ball given by the Empress to the
Emperor on his birthday.  Labouchere and his adversary
were both at four, and it was Labouchere's deal.  "Now,"
said the Emperor, "let us see whether you can turn up the
king."  Labouchere dealt, and then held out the turn-up
card, observing: "Your orders have been obeyed, sir."  The
Emperor asked him, as often as a dozen times subsequently,
how he had managed it, and never could be persuaded that
it was a mere coincidence, and that the young attaché had
taken the chance of the card being a king.  It was a trifling
example of the luck, or its reverse, that seemed to be for
ever crossing and recrossing Labouchere's path, in spite of his
own belief in nothing but the logical sequence of events.
</p>

<p>
A popular anecdote of his Petersburg days is the
following: A fussy German nobleman pushed his way into the
Chancellerie, where Labouchere was working, asking to see
the Ambassador.  "Please take a chair," said the secretary;
"he will be here soon."  "But, young man," blustered the
German, "do you know who I am?"  And he poured out a
string of imposing titles.  Labouchere looked up in
well-simulated awe.  "Pray take two chairs," he remarked
quietly, and went on writing.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P58"></a>58}</span>
</p>

<p>
When Khalil Pasha was recalled from being Ambassador
in Paris, Labouchere published the following reminiscence of
his year in the Russian capital: "Khalil Pasha once saved
me from a heavy loss, and that is why I take an interest in
him.  He, a Russian, and I sat down one evening to have a
quiet rubber.  The Russians have a hideous device of playing
with what they call a zero; that is to say, a zero is added to
all winnings and losses, so that 10 stands for 100, etc.  When
Khalil and the Russians had won their dummies, I found to
my horror that, with the zero, I had lost about £4000.
Then it came to my turn to take dummy.  I had won a game,
and we were playing for the odd trick in the last game.  If I
failed to win it I should lose about £8000.  Only two cards
remained in hand.  I had marked up six tricks and my
opponents five.  Khalil had the lead; he had the best trump
and a thirteenth card.  The only other trump was in the
hands of the dummy.  He had, therefore, only to play his
trump and then the thirteenth card to win the rubber, when
he let drop the latter card, for his fingers were of a very
'thumby' description.  Before he could take it up I
pushed the dummy's trump on it and claimed the trick.
The Russian howled, Khalil howled; they said this was very
sharp practice.  I replied that whist is essentially a game
of sharp practice, and that I was acting in accordance with
the rules.  The lookers-on were appealed to, and, of course,
gave it in my favour.  Thus did I make, or rather save,
£8000 against Russia and Turkey in alliance, through the
fault of the Turk; and it seems to me that the poor Ottoman,
now that he is at war (1877) with his ally of the card-table,
is losing the game, much as Khalil lost his game of whist to
me.  To have good cards is one thing, to know how to make
use of them quite another."[<a id="chap03fn13text"></a><a href="#chap03fn13">13</a>]
</p>

<p>
Labouchere used to tell a good story of how he got at the
secrets of the Russian Government.  His laundress was a
handsome woman, and having made friends with her on
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P59"></a>59}</span>
other than professional grounds, she happened to mention
that her husband was a compositor in the government
printing office.  The minutes of the Cabinet councils were
printed in French, of which the printers, of course, understood
nothing.  Labouchere persuaded her, for a consideration,
to obtain from her husband the loose sheets from which
the minutes had been printed.  They were brought to him
by the faithful woman every week, concealed among his
starched shirts and collars.  As soon as Lord John Russell
discovered the source of the interesting information that
reached him from Petersburg, he put a stop to the simple
intrigue.  Labouchere would always wind up his narrative
of this episode with the words: "For what reason, I wonder,
did Russell imagine, diplomacy was invented?"
</p>

<p>
After Petersburg, Dresden was Labouchere's next
appointment.  He had previously assiduously studied the
German language, in which, being a born linguist, he was
remarkably proficient.  He had been for a time to Marburg
to reside in a German family for the purpose of acquiring
conversational fluency.  All through his life one of his fads
consisted in working out on how small an income an economical
family might live in comfort, and he used frequently
to commend the management of means practised in the
bourgeois family at Marburg where he boarded.  It consisted
of a mother, two daughters, a father, and an elementary
maid-of-all-work.  The daughters did the housework
alternately.  The daughter, whose turn it was to be the
young lady, used to dress herself gorgeously every afternoon
and evening, receiving visitors or paying calls.  She would
play Chopin and Beethoven on the pianoforte, and make
herself an exceedingly agreeable social personage.  The
following week she would retire to the domestic regions and
be an excellent servant, while her sister took her turn as
<i>femme du monde</i>.  Occasionally the whole family, including
Labouchere, would be invited to a party.  It was the custom
on such occasions for both the daughters to be "young
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P60"></a>60}</span>
ladies."  The maid-of-all-work would accompany them to
the neighbour's house whither they had been bidden, carrying
their suppers in paper bags&mdash;for the hospitality proffered
at Marburg was intellectual, not material.  All the guests
brought similar paper bags, and at the conclusion of the
repast the remains of the various meals were carefully
collected by their respective owners, and carried home to figure
at the next day's <i>mittagessen</i>.  Labouchere used often to
assert that the evening parties at Marburg were the most
delightful and amusing ones he ever attended.  While there
he frequented the hospital, and attended the lectures given
for the instruction of the medical students.  He was always
fond of developing extraordinary theories on the subject of
medical science, more remarkable for their originality than
for their probable ultimate utility.  The authority upon
which these theories would be based was invariably that of
the lecturer at the Marburg Hospital.  Even as late as 1905,
Mr. Labouchere still remembered his medical student days.
He wrote to one of his sisters in that year on the occasion of
her son becoming a doctor: "A doctor is a good profession.
I learnt doctoring at Marburg in order to learn German.
I rather liked it, and have vainly offered to doctor people
gratis since then, but no one seems inclined."
</p>

<p>
Between his diplomatic appointments at Frankfort and
Petersburg, Labouchere spent several months at Florence,
and he described in <i>Truth</i> how it was that he came to have a
year's free time on his hands: "Once did I get the better of
the Foreign Office.  I was on leave in Italy when I received
a notification that Her Majesty had kindly thought fit to
appoint me Secretary of Legation to the Republic of Parana.
I had never heard of this republic.  After diligent inquiry,
I learnt that Parana was a sort of Federal town on the River
Plate, but that a few months previously the republic of that
name had shared the fate of the Kilkenny cats.  So I
remained in Italy, and comfortably drew my salary like a
bishop of a see <i>in partibus infidelium</i>.  A year later came a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P61"></a>61}</span>
despatch couched in language more remarkable for its
strength than its civility, asking me what I meant by not
proceeding to my post.  I replied that I had passed the
twelve months in making diligent inquiries respecting the
whereabouts of the Republic of Parana, hitherto without
success, but if his lordship would kindly inform me where it
was, I need hardly say that I would hasten there!"[<a id="chap03fn14text"></a><a href="#chap03fn14">14</a>]
</p>

<p>
While in Florence Labouchere witnessed the revolution
which deposed the Grand Duke and provided Tuscany with
a provisional government of her own choice, preparatory to
the union of all the Italian States under the King of Sardinia.
He was a personal friend of Mr. (afterwards Sir) James
Hudson, the English Minister at Turin, whose Nationalist
sympathies, like Labouchere's, were well known, and he was
an invaluable reporter to the Liberals in Turin of the news
of the struggle for liberty in Tuscany.  On the morning of
the revolution, after the Grand Duke and his family had
left the Pitti Palace, he, with many of his revolutionary
friends, entered the forsaken home of Austrian royalty, and
had the astuteness to procure on the spot what was left of
the famous Metternich Johannisberger for the newly founded
<i>Unione</i> Club, of which he was a member.  He had an amusing
story to tell about the flight of the grand-ducal family
from the City of Flowers, which is best repeated in his own
words, as he used to relate it to his Florentine friends after
he had returned to end his days in the place which he had
loved so well in his youth.  "The news was brought back
here by some of the people who had seen them off the
premises, that, on the road to Bologna, they all got out and
stopped an hour or two at an inn, where they all sat in a row
crying.  After this had gone on for some time, it was
discovered that the whole party had forgotten their
pocket-handkerchiefs.  Fortunately the Grand Duchess had on a
white petticoat with very ample frills, so she went round to
each of the grand-ducal family in turn, and wiped their
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P62"></a>62}</span>
eyes and noses for them in the frills of her petticoat.  And
then she did the same for the ladies and gentlemen in
waiting."
</p>

<p>
"Do I think that incident really is true?" he would reply
to his incredulous audience, "probably not.  But from what
I know of royalties in general, and from what I remember
about the grand-ducal family of Tuscany in particular, I
think that it is exceedingly probable that they would start
out on an expedition of that kind without a pocket-handkerchief
between them."[<a id="chap03fn15text"></a><a href="#chap03fn15">15</a>]  His personal reminiscences of
Victor Emmanuel II. and of Cavour were of the raciest
description and would enthral his hearers by the hour, told
as only he could tell them, with all the decorative touches of
local colour and local dialect.
</p>

<p>
He was also very fond of telling a story about an outrageous
compliment he paid to a lady belonging to the Court
of the Grand Duchess, which, if true, showed that at least
one of the resolutions he had made in the inn at Quotla di
Amalpas had been carried into successful practice: "The
Grand Duchess of Tuscany had a venerable maid of honour
above seventy years of age.  She had piercing black eyes,
and looked like an old postchaise, painted up and with new
lamps.  'How old do you think I am?' she once asked me,
with a simpering smile that caused my blood to run cold.
I hesitated, and then said 'Twenty.'  'Flatterer,' she
replied, tapping me with her fan, 'I am twenty-five.'
</p>

<p>
Having become third secretary in November, 1862, Labouchere
was appointed to Constantinople.  He wrote in <i>Truth</i>
nearly thirty years later: "I was once Secretary of Embassy
at Constantinople and I passed my time reading up Lord
Stratford's despatches before and during the Crimean War.
No one could have recognised them as the originals from
which Mr. Kinglake drew his material for a narrative of the
Ambassador's diplomatic action.  The fact was that Lord
Stratford was one of the most detestable of the human race.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P63"></a>63}</span>
He was arrogant, resentful, and spiteful.  He hated the
Emperor Nicholas because he had declined to receive him
as Ambassador to Russia, and the Crimean War was his
revenge.  In every way he endeavoured to envenom the
quarrel and to make war certain.  His power at Constantinople
was enormous.  This was because, whilst the Ambassadors
of other Powers changed, his stay there seemed eternal.
A Grand Vizier, or a Minister of Foreign Affairs, knew that,
if he offended the English Ambassador, he would never
cease plotting to drive him out, and to keep him out of power.
He therefore thought it better to keep on good terms with
him and to submit to his arrogance.  But Lord Stratford
never used his power for good.  It was enough for him to get
the Sultan to publish a decree.  This he would send home as
evidence of good government.  He never, however, explained
that the decree, when published, remained a dead letter.
When Sir Henry Bulwer (Lord Dalling) was sent as Commissioner
to the Principalities, he passed a considerable time
(as indeed was necessary) at Constantinople.  Lord Stratford
knew that Sir Henry wanted to replace him, and he feared
that he would succeed in doing so.  His rage and indignation
were therefore unbounded.  One day the Ambassador and the
Commissioner were together at the Embassy.  'I know,'
said the Ambassador, 'that you are trying to get my place,'
and he shook his fist in the face of Sir Henry, who mildly
surveyed him and shrugged his shoulders."
</p>

<p>
Sir Horace Rumbold writes charmingly of Henry Labouchere
at Constantinople in 1863.  "In August," he says,
"the torrid heat drove me to seek for a while the cool breezes
of the Bosphorus, and I then, for the first time, became
acquainted with the wonders of Constantinople.  Here I
found at the Embassy Edward Herbert and got to know that
remarkable, <i>original</i>, and most talented and kind-hearted
of would-be cynics, Henry Labouchere."[<a id="chap03fn16text"></a><a href="#chap03fn16">16</a>]  Later on, in the
same volume of reminiscences, he gives another picture of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P64"></a>64}</span>
the young secretary, whose diplomatic career was, however,
soon to come to a close.  "The Pisani dynasty were still
masters of the situation when I arrived.  Under the, in
many ways, unfortunate tenure of the Embassy by Sir
Henry Bulwer, Alexander Pisani, best known as the 'Count,'
who was simply the Keeper of the Archives, had been made
head of the Diplomatic Chancellerie of the Embassy, to the
intense disgust of successive secretaries properly belonging to
the Service.  Pisani, it was said, had extorted this abnormal
appointment from his chief by threatening to resign and
write his memoirs.  Henry Labouchere, among others,
greatly resented the arrangement.  Some years before, he
had a passage of arms with the 'Count,' who had reproved
him, so to speak, officially for absenting himself for the day
from the Chancery on some occasion, without applying to
him for leave to do so.  The ridiculous affair was referred
to Sir Henry Bulwer, and gave my friend Labby a charming
opportunity of describing the 'Count' in a formal letter to
the Ambassador.  'It seems to me,' he wrote, 'a singular
dispensation that places a Greek nobleman of Venetian
extraction, who profited by the advantages of a Pera
education, in authority over a body of English Gentlemen.'"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Labouchere was always very amusing on the subject
of his chief at Constantinople.  He said that Lord Balling
could not understand the value of money.  He was so
generous that he was always in financial difficulties.  At one
time the Embassy was reduced to such straits that there was
no money to buy any decent wine.  The difficulty was met
in the following manner: At official dinners the grand-looking
<i>maître d'hôtel</i> would solemnly say before pouring out the
wine, "Château Lafitte '48," or "La Rose '52," and so on,
all through dinner.  As a matter of fact, the wine had really
come from the neighbouring Greek isles, and had been
doctored with an infusion of prunes to tone down the flavour
of tar, which is inseparable from these insular vintages.
Lord Dalling himself was so anxious to please that he would
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P65"></a>65}</span>
quaff glass after glass of the horrible beverage, swallowing
numberless pills the while as an antidote.
</p>

<p>
There are many versions of the incident with which
Labouchere chose to conclude his relations with the Diplomatic
Service.  The Foreign Office records of the date are
not yet available, but I am indebted to Sir Audley Gosling
for his recollections of the affair as it happened.  In the
summer of 1864, Labouchere found himself at Baden-Baden,
enjoying the relaxation of a little gambling after his strenuous
work in the service of his country.  While there he received
from Lord Russell, the Foreign Secretary, the usual
stereotyped announcement of his promotion in the Diplomatic
Service.  It ran: "I have to inform you that Her Majesty
has, on my recommendation, been pleased to promote you
to be a Second Secretary in the Diplomatic Service to reside
at Buenos Ayres."
</p>

<p>
Labouchere is said to have replied as follows: "I have
the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Lordship's
despatch, informing me of my promotion as Second Secretary
to Her Majesty's Legation at Buenos Ayres.  I beg to state
that, if residing at Baden-Baden I can fulfil those duties, I
shall be pleased to accept the appointment."  As this was
the second joke he had played on Lord Russell, he was
politely told that there was no further use for his services.[<a id="chap03fn17text"></a><a href="#chap03fn17">17</a>]
</p>

<p>
A successful "system" is not an essential part of the
educational equipment of a diplomat, but it may on occasion
be a very useful extra to his other accomplishments.
Mr. Labouchere found it so.  "I used at one time," he said, "to
take the waters every year at Homburg, and I invariably
paid the expenses of my trip out of my winnings at the
gambling-tables.  It may have been luck, or it may have
been system; but I give my system for what it is worth.  I
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P66"></a>66}</span>
used to write the following figures on a piece of paper: 3, 4,
5, 6, 7.  My stake was always the top and bottom figure
added together.  If I won, I scratched out these figures; if I
lost, I wrote down the stake at the bottom of the figures, and
I went on playing until all the figures on my piece of paper
were erased.  Thus my first stake (and I played indifferently
on red or black) would be ten.  If I won it, I scratched out
three and seven.  My next stake would be ten again, as four
and six make ten.  If I lost it, I wrote down ten at the bottom
of my list of figures, and played fourteen, being the addition
of the first and last figure on the list, viz. fourteen.  The
basis of the 'system' was this.  Before reaching the
maximum, I could play a series of even chances for about two
hours, and if during these two hours I won one quarter as
many times as the bank, plus five, all my figures were
erased.  During these two hours an even chance would be
produced two hundred times.  If, therefore, I won fifty-five
times, and the bank won one hundred and forty-five times,
I was the winner of twenty-five napoleons, florins, or
whatever was my unit.  Now let any one produce an even chance
by tossing up a coin and always crying 'heads,' he will find
that he may go on until Doomsday before the 'tails' exceed
the 'heads,' or the 'heads' exceed the 'tails,' by ninety-five.
I found this system in a letter from Condorcet to a
friend, which I read in a book that I purchased at a stall on
the 'Quai' at Paris.  It may have been, as I have said,
only luck; but all I can say is, that whenever I played it I
invariably won."
</p>

<p>
One of Mr. Labouchere's oldest friends, Mrs. Crawford,
recently wrote to me a letter in which she made the following
lucid remarks about his career in the Diplomatic Service:
"I was acquainted," she says, "with many of his diplomatic
comrades, and they often spoke of him in chat with me.
Some were friendly, some were not.  He had a very
unguarded tongue, and discharged his shafts of satire, irony,
humour in all directions, and every arrow that hit made an
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P67"></a>67}</span>
enemy.  I, mentally, used to take this into account in
judging of their judgments, and the habit, which does not
exist in England, of searching for mitigating circumstances
helped me to make a fair and true estimate of his complex
nature.  I think he rather enjoyed, but <i>passagèrement</i>, being
thought a Richard III., an Iago&mdash;an inveterate gambler.  I
soon came to the conclusion that this was partly due to a
reaction against the idolatrous attitude of the English middle
class and religious people towards Victoria and Albert, for
it was shockingly fulsome&mdash;and the Queen early showed
hostility towards him.  His uncle, Lord Taunton, reflected
her known sentiments, and so did Lord Clarendon.  He was
wrong, very wrong, to have treated the vile crime of
Grenville Murray, and committed too in an Office capacity, as
a thing of no consequence and the stumble made by an
exceedingly clever man&mdash;a too great rarity in the British
Consular Service.  I have some recollection that she was
furious with the Prince of Wales, who had not the virtue,
in his early years at any rate, of reticence in speaking,
for, on the authority of Mr. Labouchere, taking Grenville
Murray's part against the Foreign Office in her presence.
This, however, was only one of the reasons of her fixed
hostility...."
</p>

<p>
The crime to which Mrs. Crawford refers as having been
committed by Grenville Murray in an official capacity was
that of forwarding private news to the <i>Morning Post</i> (to which
paper he was secretly acting as correspondent) in the Foreign
Office bag from Vienna, where he was an attaché in 1852,
under Lord Westmorland.  Mr. Labouchere declared in
<i>Truth</i> that Lord Palmerston, having a private grudge against
Prince Schwarzenberg, the Prime Minister of Austria, and
wishing for special information about him to reach the
British public, had come to a private understanding with
Grenville Murray that his journalistic correspondence would
be winked at.  Unfortunately the "copy" fell into the
hands of Lord Westmorland, who demanded from Lord
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P68"></a>68}</span>
Palmerston the instant dismissal of Murray.  Murray was
not dismissed, but in a year's time was transferred to
Constantinople, where Lord Stratford de Redcliffe reigned
supreme.  He had, of course, heard from Lord Westmorland
about Murray's journalistic indiscretions, and hated him
accordingly.  Murray retorted by holding up his chief to
every sort of ridicule to the English magazine-reading public;
for he was a clever writer, and contributed largely to
<i>Household Words</i>, then under the editorship of Charles Dickens.
The Foreign Office soon thought it necessary to remove him,
and he was appointed to the consul-generalship of Odessa.
At Odessa the consul was just as unpopular as the attaché
had been at Vienna and Constantinople.  The defence of
Grenville Murray, to which Mrs. Crawford refers, was
probably founded upon facts contained in the following
passage of an "Anecdotal Photograph" of Lord Derby,
published by Mr. Labouchere in an early number of <i>Truth</i>:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
When Lord Derby was at the head of the Foreign Office, he
left all the appointments in the Diplomatic Service to the
permanent officials, and, owing to this pococurantism, he did an
act of injustice to one of the most brilliant <i>littérateurs</i> of the day.
The gentleman in question had a consulship in the East.  An able
and brilliant man, he was naturally a <i>persona ingrata</i> to the high
priests of red tape, and between them and him there was
perpetual war, which at length culminated in a determination to
remove him <i>per fas</i> or <i>per nefas</i> from the service.  Certain
charges were accordingly brought against this gentleman, who
was put on his defence.  The accused, who was then in London,
applied for copies of certain papers from the archives of the
Foreign Office which he considered essential to his complete
exculpation.  The officials at first declined to grant them, but,
after a long correspondence, admitted the justice of the claim.
The papers were sent accordingly, together with two separate
letters, both bearing the same date.  One announced that the
documents had been forwarded, the other that Lord Derby had
made up his mind on the whole case, and his decision was in these
words: "I have accordingly advised the Queen to cancel your
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P69"></a>69}</span>
commission as &mdash;&mdash;, and it is hereby cancelled accordingly."  The
recipient of this interesting epistle was at first inclined to
treat it as a bad joke, but soon found that it was an authentic
fact.[<a id="chap03fn18text"></a><a href="#chap03fn18">18</a>]
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
I have the great good fortune also to have received from
Mr. Wilfrid Blunt a brief memoir of Mr. Labouchere, which
commences in his early diplomatic days, and though it carries
us on almost to the end of his life, I think that its publication
here will enable those readers who did not know Mr. Labouchere
personally to get a sincere impression of the whole of his
career, which cannot fail to be of assistance to them in
elucidating his curious original personality from the maze of
dates and details which are the inevitable appendages of a
comprehensive biography.  Mr. Blunt writes as follows:
</p>

<p class="quote">
Feb. 13, 1913.

<p class="quote">
My acquaintance with Henry Labouchere dates, if I
remember rightly, from the early spring of 1861.  We were
both then in the Diplomatic Service, and though not actually
employed together, I had just succeeded him as unpaid
attaché at the Frankfort Legation, and found him still lingering
there when I came to take up my not very onerous duties
that year under our chief, Sir Alexander Malet, Edward Malet's
father.  Labouchere's attraction to Frankfort was not Frankfort
itself, but its close neighbourhood to Hombourg, where the
gambling-tables still flourished, and where he spent nearly all
his time.  By rights he ought to have been at St. Petersburg,
but pretended that he could not afford to travel to his new post
except on foot, and so was staying on waiting to have his expenses
paid by Government.  His life at that time was an avowedly
disreputable one, the society of Hombourg being what it was;
and he was looked upon by the more strait-laced ladies of the
Corps Diplomatique as something of a pariah.  There was a
good deal of talk about him, opinions being divided as to whether
he was more knave or fool, greenhorn or knowing fellow, all
which amused him greatly.  He was in reality the good-hearted
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P70"></a>70}</span>
cynic the world has since acknowledged him to be, with a keen
appreciation of the <i>comédie humaine</i>, a contempt for aristocratic
shams, and a philosopher's taste for low society.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I have a coloured caricature I made of him of that date, 1861,
in which he is represented as undergoing a conversion to
respectability at the hands of Countess d'Usedom, the Olympia of
the Bismarck memoirs, and wife of the Prussian Ambassador,
with her two Scotch nieces in the preposterous crinoline dresses
of the time.  He figures in it as a round-faced young man with
highly coloured cheeks, and an air of mock modesty which is very
characteristic.  It is labelled "The Deformed Transformed."
</p>

<p class="quote">
Later, I used to see him pretty frequently in London at the
St. James' Club, of which we were both members.  He was
already beginning to be a recognised wit, and a central figure
among talkers in the smoking-room.  But I remember old
Paddy Green of Evans' still maintaining that he was for all that
a simple-minded fellow, made to be the prey of rogues.  It was
as such that he had known him some years before when Labouchere
first appeared in London life and took up his quarters
at Evans' Hotel in Covent Garden.  The good Irishman had
dolorous stories of the way in which his protégé had then been
fleeced.  "Poor Labouchere, poor Labouchere," he used to say,
in his paternally emotional voice; "a good young man, but
always his own worst enemy."  His own worst enemy he
certainly often was.  I remember his coming into the Club one
evening, it must have been in 1865, when he had just been elected
M.P. for Windsor, and boasting to all of us who would listen to
him, with every detail, how he had bribed the free and intelligent
electors of the Royal Borough, an imprudence which caused him
the misfortune of his being unseated immediately afterwards on
petition.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Of the years that followed, when he was making his name as
a journalist, and his fortune on the Stock Exchange, I have
nothing particular to record.  I came once more into close
connection with him in 1882, at the time of the trial of Arabi at
Cairo after Tel-el-Kebir.  Labouchere, during the early months
of the year, had been among those Radicals who in the House of
Commons had followed Chamberlain and Dilke in pressing
intervention in Egypt on the Foreign Office, and he made no
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P71"></a>71}</span>
secret of the reason&mdash;he was a holder of Egyptian Bonds.  The
bombardment of Alexandria and the massacre of Tel-el-Kebir,
with the revelations which followed of the intrigues which had
caused the war, proved, however, too much for his political
conscience, which was really sound, and having unloaded his
Egyptian stock, which had gone up to higher prices (for he was not a
man to neglect a Stock Exchange opportunity), he frankly
repented of his sin, and from that time onwards did his best to repair
the wrong to Egypt he had joined in doing.  He subscribed
handsomely to the "Arabi Defence Fund," was always ready to ask
questions in the House, and did not scruple to reproach the Grand
Old Man with his lapses at Cairo and in the Soudan from his
Midlothian principles.  In this connection I saw much of him
from 1883 to 1885, years during which Egypt occupied so large
a share of public attention, and always found him interested in
the Egyptian cause and helpful.
</p>

<p class="quote">
He was living then in Queen Anne's Gate, and I was pretty
sure to find him in the morning, and often stayed to lunch with
him and his wife.  He was uniformly gay and pleasant and ready
to give news.  No one ever was more generous in sharing his
political knowledge with his friends, and I could count on him to
tell me the true and exact truth of what was going on in the
directions that interested me, without regard to the rules of
secrecy so many public men affect.  Of his wit too he was copiously
lavish, as only those are who have it in supreme abundance,
giving of his very best to a single listener as freely as to a larger
audience.  This, I always think, is the test of genius in the
department of brilliant talking, and no one ever shone there more
conspicuously than he did.  His worldly wisdom was wonderful.
Nor was it confined to things at home, the House of Commons,
and the intrigue of Downing Street.  He was really the only
English Radical, with Dilke, who had an accurate acquaintance
with affairs abroad, and he had his Europe at his finger-ends.
He would have made an admirable ambassador, where any difficult
matters had to be carried through, and he ought certainly
to have been given the Embassy he so much desired at Washington.
It was always his ambition, even stronger I think than
that of holding Cabinet Office, to go back to his old diplomatic
profession and give serious proof of his capacity in a service
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P72"></a>72}</span>
where, as a young man, he had played the fool.  The Foreign
Office would have found itself the stronger for his help.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Our sympathy, which had begun about Egypt, was carried on,
I am glad to remember, during the years of stress which followed,
also to Ireland; and from first to last my experience of his political
action has been that of a man courageously consistent in his love
of liberty, his hatred of tyranny, and his contempt of the
insincerities of public life.  He was never taken in by the false
arguments with which politicians conceal their treacheries, and he
was never himself a betrayer.  If my testimony can be of any
service to his memory as an honest man, I freely give it.
</p>

<p class="quote">
The last time I saw him was in the summer of 1902, when he
came down with his wife and daughter to spend a week-end,
July 12th to 14th, with me and my wife in Sussex.  He had
resolved to pass the rest of his days at Florence, and it was a
farewell visit that he paid us.  He had just bought Michael
Angelo's Villa, and talked much about it and his design, philistine
that he was, of turning it inside out, fitting it with electric
light, and otherwise bedevilling it with modern improvements,
uprooting the old trees in the <i>podere</i> and planting new ones.
On matters of this sort he was a terrible barbarian, and took
delight in playing the vandal with places and things which the
rest of the world held in reverence.  "Old Michael," he explained,
"knew nothing about the comforts of a modern establishment,
and it was time that he should learn them."  Apart from this
little <i>méchanceté</i>, he proved himself a most delectable companion,
giving us a true feast of wit and wisdom the whole Sunday
through.  Sibyl, Lady Queensberry, was of our party, and Colonel
Bill Gordon, General Gordon's nephew, with whom he had much
talk about Khartoum and Egypt.  Gordon was a good talker
on his own subjects, and they got on well together, sitting up till
half-past one the first night, telling story after story.  Among
them, I remember, Labouchere gave us accounts of his adventures
in Mexico, and also of a ride he had taken from Damascus to
Palmyra with Lady Ellenborough and her Bedouin husband,
Sheykh Mijwel el Mizrab, with reminiscences of the early days
we had spent together in the Diplomatic Service, his gambling
acquaintances at Hombourg, and his duel in Sweden.  He was
especially interested in this visit to the Weald of Sussex, and in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P73"></a>73}</span>
his having passed in the train almost within sight of Broome
Hall, under Leith Hill, where he had lived as a boy.  He had not
been that way since, he said.  The second evening he was less
brilliant, as Hilaire Belloc had joined our party, a rival talker
to whom he left the monopoly of our entertainment.  But it
was an altogether pleasant two days that we passed together.
I am glad to have the recollection of them.  Alas, they were the
last we were to see of him, for he left England soon afterwards,
and we never met again.

CHAPTER IV
<br><br>
PARLIAMENTARY AMBITIONS
</h3>

<p class="t3">
(1866-1869)
</p>

<p>
Being asked on some occasion, "Why do men enter
Parliament?" Mr. Labouchere replied: "Some of
them enter Parliament because they have been local Bulls of
Bashan, and consider that in the localities where they have
roared, and pawed the ground, they will be even more
important than heretofore; some because they want to be peers,
baronets, and knights; some because they have a fad to air;
some because they want to have a try at climbing the greasy
pole of office; some because they have heard that the House
of Commons is the best club in London; some because they
delude themselves that they are orators; some for want of
anything better to do; some because they want to make a bit
out of company promoting; and some because they have a
vague notion that they are going to benefit their country
by their devotion to legislative business."  He frankly
confessed, however, that none of the above considerations had
influenced him in his own decision to enter upon a
parliamentary life.  Curiosity had been his inducement in the
first place, and secondly, a conviction that the House would
benefit considerably from contact with so sound a Radical as
himself.
</p>

<p>
In the autumn of the year that he left the Diplomatic
Service, it was suggested to Mr. Labouchere by several
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P75"></a>75}</span>
friends that he should come forward as a candidate in the
next General Election for the borough of New Windsor.
There was already another Liberal in the field&mdash;Mr. Flower
of Stratford-on-Avon.  Labouchere decided to confer with
him on the subject.  They met, accordingly, at the Reform
Club, Labouchere having been previously warned by the
Town Clerk of Windsor, Mr. Darvill, to act quite independently
of Flower, as he was in the hands of agents, in whom
the leading men of the place had little confidence.
Mr. Labouchere describes in his own words the upshot of the
interview: "We met at the Reform Club, in the presence of
Mr. Grant (one of Flower's agents) and Mr. Darvill, junior.
As, however, both of us evidently thought that only one
Liberal could be returned at Windsor, and as each of us
intended to be that Liberal, we separated without coming to
any arrangement to act together."[<a id="chap04fn1text"></a><a href="#chap04fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p>
Labouchere then went abroad, returning to England in
January for a fortnight, during which time he gave a dinner
at Windsor, held a public meeting, and identified himself as
much as it was possible to do, in so short a time, with the
local interests of the borough.  In May, 1865, Mr. Flower
retired from the candidature, because he felt that his agents,
Grant and Dunn, had compromised him by corrupt practices.
As these gentlemen had hired as many as twenty
public houses for committee rooms, a number ludicrously out
of proportion to the size of the constituency, he acted wisely
in doing so.  He informed Labouchere of his decision.
Mr. Darvill also wrote, recommending Labouchere to return to
England, and if he really intended to stand for Windsor, to
take some steps for insuring his return by appointing agents,
and taking the usual preliminary precautions.
</p>

<p>
To continue the narrative in Mr. Labouchere's own
words: "Sir Henry Hoare, a day or two after my return to
England, called upon me to tell me that he had been in
communication with Mr. Darvill, and that as Mr. Darvill
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P76"></a>76}</span>
had told me he thought that, if two Liberal candidates acted
firmly together, both might be returned, he came to propose
to me to make common cause with him.  The next day we
called together on Mr. Durrant, a London solicitor, who had
acted for Sir Henry Hoare, and we begged him to go down to
Windsor, and after seeing the principal Liberals, to report to
us the state of affairs.  This he did.  He told us Mr. Flower
had engaged twenty committee rooms&mdash;a number which was
clearly too great, and he recommended us to take on nine of
them.  We sent him down to Windsor again to arrange
about the committee rooms and about taking on agents, and
he, in conjunction with Mr. Last, retained the usual Liberal
agents, who were the same as had been engaged by Mr. Flower.
It was distinctly understood at the same time, that
we only took on nine committee rooms.  Mr. Flower, after,
I believe, a long correspondence with Mr. Cleave, agreed
to pay for the eleven committee rooms which he had engaged.
Sir Henry Hoare and I were both returned as members for
Windsor."
</p>

<p>
It was an unfortunate action, however, on the part of the
two Liberal candidates to make use of the same agents who
had compromised Mr. Flower, and it cost them their seats.
The election took place in November, 1865, and the result of
the poll was as follows:
</p>

<pre style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">
  Sir Henry Hoare             324 votes
  Mr. Labouchere              323   "
  Mr. Vansittart (Cons.)     291   "
  Col. Vyse (Cons.)           261   "
</pre>

<p><br></p>

<p>
On April 26, 1866, the chairman of a select committee,[<a id="chap04fn2text"></a><a href="#chap04fn2">2</a>]
appointed to try the merits of the petition against the return
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P77"></a>77}</span>
of Sir Henry Hoare and Mr. Labouchere for the borough of
New Windsor, on the grounds that it was obtained by means
of bribery, treating, and undue influence, announced that the
committee had arrived at the following determination:
</p>

<p>
"That Sir Henry Ainslie Hoare is not duly elected a
burgess to serve in the present parliament for the borough of
New Windsor.  That Henry Labouchere, Esq., is not duly
elected to serve in the present parliament for the borough of
New Windsor.  That Sir Henry Ainslie Hoare is, by his
agents, guilty of bribery.  That it has been proved that
various acts of bribery have been committed by the agents of
the sitting members by the engagement of an excessive
number of public houses in which it was proved that none of
the legitimate business of the election was transacted, and
for which sums varying from £10 to £20 were paid.  That
it has not been proved that such acts were committed with
the knowledge or consent of the said Sir Henry Hoare and
the said Henry Labouchere, Esq.  That the committee have
no reason to believe that bribery and corruption extensively
prevailed at the last election for the borough of New
Windsor."
</p>

<p>
The committee had sat for six days before the above
decision was arrived at, and many were the entertaining
encounters between the defendants' counsel, the great
Mr. Serjeant Ballantine, and the witnesses for the petitioners.
One of the latter explained that he had voted for the
Conservatives because Mr. Vansittart was a "very nice old
man."  Under cross-examination it was elicited with difficulty that
Mr. Vansittart had not given his wife and daughter each
a new dress.  Being further pressed, he announced that
he could prove it.  "How?" questioned the counsel.  "I
haven't got no wife nor no daughter," complained the
witness.  A charge of presenting a silk gown to the wife of
one of the electors was preferred against Henry Labouchere.
He did not deny having done so.  "The lady in question,"
he explained, "was extremely good-looking, and I have
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P78"></a>78}</span>
frequently noticed that a present of finery is a simple way to
win the female heart.  I regret that, in the particular case,
I was unsuccessful, but, good God, you do not insinuate for a
moment, do you, that I intended her husband to know
anything about the affair?"
</p>

<p>
The line of defence taken up by Labouchere will easily be
seen by reading the letter he sent to the <i>Times</i> the day after
the committee had reached their decision.  I give it in full,
with the exception of some sentences that have already been
quoted:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
ALBANY, April 26.
</p>

<p class="quote">
SIR,&mdash;In an article to-day on the recent decision of the
Election Committees, you allude to the case of Windsor.
</p>

<p class="quote">
As your observations tend to lead those who read them to
form the conclusion that my late constituents are somewhat
corrupt, in justice to them, I should feel obliged to you to allow
me to say a few words in their defence.  It may be useful to
future candidates to know on what grounds Sir Henry Hoare
and I have been unseated....
</p>

<p class="quote">
We were petitioned against on the usual charges of bribery
and intimidation.  To the charges of direct bribery and indirectly
bribing by the promise of work we replied, I believe, to the
satisfaction of the Committee.  The case of the petitioners rested
upon the charge that we had engaged too many committee rooms.
</p>

<p class="quote">
The Committee unseated us because: "It had been proved
that acts of bribery had been committed by the engagement, by
the agents of the sitting members, of an excessive number of
public houses, in which it was proved that none of the legitimate
business of the election was transacted, and for which sums
varying from £10 to £20 were paid.  That it has not been proved
that such acts were committed with the knowledge or consent
of the said Sir Henry Hoare and the said Henry Labouchere."
</p>

<p class="quote">
Now this decision must have been come to on the supposition
that Sir Henry Hoare and I were responsible for the eleven
committee rooms, paid for by Mr. Flower, because we both swore
that the nine committee rooms were taken with "knowledge and
consent."  The Committee consequently must have concluded
either that Mr. Flower, Mr. Durrant, Sir H. Hoare, and myself
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P79"></a>79}</span>
were guilty of perjury in swearing that the payment by
Mr. Flower was <i>bona fide</i>, or that Sir H. Hoare and I, in taking on
agents in May, became responsible for what these agents had
done in the interests of a third party during the winter.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Our case rested on the fact that "none of the legitimate
business of the election" was transacted in Mr. Flower's public
houses, and that if a bill with the words "Committee Rooms" was
hung over any room in Mr. Flower's public houses it was because
the publicans considered they would advertise their own political
principles by showing that they had been engaged by a Liberal
candidate who had retired.  Every one knows that, if an
electioneering bill over a public house is an advertisement for a
candidate, it is also an advertisement for the public house, and
that publicans like it to be supposed that they belong to one or
other of the parties during a contested election.  As a matter
of fact some of Mr. Flower's publicans did not vote for me.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I may then fairly state that my late colleague and I were
unseated because one of our agents had been concerned, months
before he became our agent, in taking public houses in undue
numbers for Mr. Flower.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Now, sir, I would venture to call the attention of the Legislature
to the new and strange principle of jurisprudence on which
the decision of the Windsor Election Committee has been based.
I do so in the interests of all candidates, for, as far as I am
concerned, I have unfortunately no appeal against the decision.
</p>

<p class="quote">
It is sufficiently difficult to prevent over zealous committee
men and agents from compromising their candidate during the
election; but, if he is to be retrospectively responsible for all
their previous acts, I venture to say that no candidate can expect
to hold his seat against a petition.  Were the retrospective
responsibility introduced into the procedure of courts of law no
man would be safe.  I might, sir, to-morrow have the advantage
of making your acquaintance.  Some days later I might take a
servant whom you had formerly employed.  Ought I to be hung
if it were subsequently shown that you and the servant had
murdered some one last January in London, while I was in
Italy?
</p>

<p class="quote">
Were I still a member of the Legislature, I should myself
point out the necessity of a reform in the composition of election
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P80"></a>80}</span>
committees.  As an elector of Westminster, I shall, through my
representative, Capt. Grosvenor, present a petition to the House
of Commons praying that some alteration be made in the present
system, and that a properly qualified judge be added to every
committee to explain the elementary principles of jurisprudence
to well-intentioned gentlemen who know nothing about
them.[<a id="chap04fn3text"></a><a href="#chap04fn3">3</a>]&mdash;I am, Sir, Your obedient servant,
</p>

<p class="quote">
H. LABOUCHERE.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
A number of extremely interesting letters appeared in the
<i>Times</i>, on the subject of the New Windsor Election Petition,
one other, only, of which I shall quote, as it puts the case for
Mr. Labouchere and his colleagues in a perfectly clear light.
It runs as follows:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
SIR,&mdash;My name having prominently appeared in the proceeding
before the Election Committee in this case, and in
communications made to you by Sir Henry Hoare and Mr. Labouchere,
complaining of the decision of the committee, I trust you
will not refuse me an opportunity of corroborating their
statements.  I may say, as a prelude, that the agents had the most
distinct directions to do nothing in contradiction of the statutes
relating to the election of members to serve in Parliament, and
I proved, in evidence, my written instructions to that effect.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Sir Henry Hoare and Mr. Labouchere, being aware that
Mr. Flower had retired by reason of his belief that he had been
compromised by his agents, were most anxious to avoid becoming
in any way identified with their proceedings; and, as regards the
public houses, which had been taken on his behalf, the late
members entirely repudiated, both personally, and through me,
having anything whatever to do with them.
</p>

<p class="quote">
No one had authority to hire committee rooms but Mr. Last,
the head agent at Windsor, and no complaint is made in
the Committee's Report in respect of the nine houses engaged
by him.  Not a shilling has, to my knowledge or belief, been
paid, or promised on account, of what I may, for brevity, call
"Mr. Flower's public houses"; so that, in fact, these houses were
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P81"></a>81}</span>
neither hired by, paid for, nor used by the late members or their
agents.
</p>

<p class="quote">
The unseating, therefore, of the late members for New
Windsor upon the grounds stated in the Report of the Committee
is, I venture to suggest, unprecedented in the annals of election
petitions, and affords just ground for complaint, and for giving,
in future cases some appeal, where there may be a similar
miscarriage of justice.[<a id="chap04fn4text"></a><a href="#chap04fn4">4</a>]&mdash;I am, Sir, Your obedient servant,
</p>

<p class="quote">
G. J. DURRANT.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Henry Labouchere made his maiden speech during the six
months that he was member for New Windsor.  It was upon
an uninteresting and complicated subject&mdash;namely, the
inadequacy of our Neutrality Law to enable us to fulfil our
international obligations towards foreign countries.  The
debate, begun in February, continued well into the March of
1866.  Labouchere made his speech on the 22nd of February.
During the course of it he said that, having passed ten years
in the Diplomatic Service, he had given some consideration to
the subject of International Law, which had led him to
believe that, from defects and inefficiency, our Neutrality
Law was fraught not only with future danger to ourselves,
but was calculated to prevent us from acting justly towards
our Allies.  He quoted, in support of his argument, the
relations of England with the United States of America, the
sympathy of America with Fenianism, and our loss of
commerce with America.[<a id="chap04fn5text"></a><a href="#chap04fn5">5</a>]  On March 7 he voted in favour
of the Church Rates Abolition Bill, which was read for the
second time on that day and committed.
</p>

<p>
Of course he was very funny on the subject of the election
at New Windsor.  He was fond of relating how it was that he
first became an M.P.  "I had to kiss the babies," he said,
"pay compliments to their mothers, and explain the beauties
of Liberalism to their fathers, who never could be got to say
how they would vote.  On the day of the election everything
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P82"></a>82}</span>
turned upon half a dozen votes.  I remember one Tory went
out to fish in a punt, and the boatman who accompanied
him was induced to keep him well out in the middle of the
river, until the polling hour had passed.  Another aged and
decrepid Tory was kept in the house by having cabs run at
him whenever he tried to issue from his door.  Finally the
Liberals won the day.  On this the Tories petitioned.  The
committee decided that there had been no bribery, but
unseated my colleague and myself because they thought that
we had hired an excessive number of committee rooms."
</p>

<p>
And again: "One man at this election amused me.  He
hung about outside my committee room, and whenever he
saw me he wrung my hand.  On my first interview with this
patriot, he informed me that, at an early hour of the morning,
he had personated Dr. Cumming, and had voted for me as
that divine.  Each time I saw him during the day, he said
that he had been personating some one, and always a
clergyman.  I remonstrated with him but uselessly."
</p>

<p>
The playwright, Herman Merivale, tells an anecdote
about Henry Labouchere, in connection with the Windsor
election, which it is very probable he heard from the whilom
member himself.  "Lord Taunton," writes Merivale, "uncle
and precursor of our more famous Labby, is fabled to have
lived in a general state of alarm at the strange proclivities of
that unchastened heir, who has furnished the world with
more amusing stories of a curious humour than any public
man of his time.  It is said that when Lord Taunton heard
that his nephew contemplated public life, and proposed to
stand for one of the county divisions in the district, he was
much pleased at such a sign of grace, and asked if he could
do anything for him.  'Really I think not,' replied the
younger Henry, 'but I don't know.  If you would put on
your peer's robes, and walk arm-in-arm with me down the
High Street of Windsor, it might have a good effect."[<a id="chap04fn6text"></a><a href="#chap04fn6">6</a>]
</p>

<p>
Another opportunity soon occurred for Labouchere to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P83"></a>83}</span>
re-enter the House of Commons.  On the death of Mr. Robert
Hanbury, one of the members for Middlesex, he presented
himself to the electors, and was returned without opposition,
on April 16, 1867.  An extract from his address to the electors,
dated March 29, is not without interest, as in it he unblushingly
gives expression to the democratic principles to which
he remained so faithful throughout his career.  "Should
you do me the honour," he said, "to return me to Parliament,
it would be my first duty to co-operate with those who desire
to effect the passage of an honest and straightforward
measure of reform&mdash;such a measure as would prove to the
large body of artisans and working men, whom I hold to be
entitled to the franchise, that the House of Commons is not
afraid of the people, nor averse to the free extension of
political privileges, nor disposed to deny to the intelligent
operatives a share in the government of the country to whose
burdens they are called upon to contribute.  If the Reform
Bill proposed by the Tory Ministry is not capable of
adaptation to such an end, I should not hesitate to give my
adherence to any cause which may seem the most calculated
to attain the desired object."[<a id="chap04fn7text"></a><a href="#chap04fn7">7</a>]
</p>

<p>
While he was member for Middlesex, Labouchere was
assiduous in his parliamentary duties.  He spoke frequently
and to the point, on such subjects as the "Expenses of
Voters,"[<a id="chap04fn8text"></a><a href="#chap04fn8">8</a>] on "the Sale of Liquor on Sundays Bill"[<a id="chap04fn9text"></a><a href="#chap04fn9">9</a>] (a
characteristically amusing speech), on "Licences" (Brewers'),[<a id="chap04fn10text"></a><a href="#chap04fn10">10</a>]
on the "Military Knights of Windsor attending Church,"[<a id="chap04fn11text"></a><a href="#chap04fn11">11</a>]
on "Appeals in the House of Lords."[<a id="chap04fn12text"></a><a href="#chap04fn12">12</a>]  He objected to a
vote to complete the sum of £2135 for building new Embassy
houses in Madrid and Paris,[<a id="chap04fn13text"></a><a href="#chap04fn13">13</a>] and offered some practical
suggestions as to the building (or buying) of new Embassy
buildings at Therapia.[<a id="chap04fn14text"></a><a href="#chap04fn14">14</a>]
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P84"></a>84}</span>
</p>

<p>
In short, he was an active and useful member.  The
speeches which have been most frequently quoted are the
ones which he made on May 14, protesting against a vote
of £137,524, for the upkeep of the Royal Parks and Pleasure
Grounds,[<a id="chap04fn15text"></a><a href="#chap04fn15">15</a>] 
and his two speeches on the Public Schools Bill.[<a id="chap04fn16text"></a><a href="#chap04fn16">16</a>]  In
the former he asserted that it was unjust and quite illogical
to prohibit the entrance of cabs into Hyde Park.  Most of
his friends, he announced, were not in a position to keep
their own carriages, yet they passionately longed to drive
about in the haunts of fashion.  He himself suffered cruelly
under the same longing and disability, and such an exclusion,
he explained, was quite incompatible with the spirit of
Liberalism.  He referred to the regulations concerning the
public parks of Vienna and Paris to show that the prejudice
against hired vehicles was entirely British and snobbish.
</p>

<p>
On another occasion, Mr. Lowe had moved a clause to the
effect that boys educated at public schools should be
examined once a year, by an Inspector of Education, in simple
reading, writing, and arithmetic, and that a report as to their
attainments should be laid before Parliament.
</p>

<p>
On this Labouchere made an excellent speech.  In the
course of it, he said that he hoped Mr. Lowe's clause would
be pressed to a division, because it was evident that most
pupils at public schools did not know as much as an average
charity boy.  Complaint had been made that the whole time
of public school boys was taken up by the study of Latin and
Greek, but, as a matter of fact, they learned very little of these
languages.  An ordinarily educated German could converse
with a foreigner in Latin, if the two had no other language in
common, but how many Englishmen carried from a public
school sufficient Latin to do this?  He confessed that he
himself, although he might be able to translate some half a
dozen words of Latin, was wholly unable to translate a
sentence of Greek, although he had studied those languages
for years at a public school.  He complained that this
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P85"></a>85}</span>
ignorance was the fault of a system, and the misfortune of
those who were obliged to undergo it.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Labouchere used to relate the following reminiscence
of the days when he was member for Middlesex: "It
is a curious fact&mdash;such is the irony of fate&mdash;that these dues
(the Middlesex Coal Dues) were once prolonged owing to me.
About twenty years ago, I was member for Middlesex.  A
Bill was brought forward to prolong the dues in order to
borrow the money for certain Metropolitan improvements.
Now the dues are collected from the inhabitants, not only of
the metropolis, but of all Middlesex.  My constituents
wanted the bridges over the Thames and the Lea, beyond the
Metropolitan area, to be freed.  So I persistently opposed the
Bill by much talking, by amendments, and other such
devices (for although blocking had not been invented,
obstruction was even then not without its resources).  This
led to negotiation, and it was finally agreed that the
prolongation should be for a still longer period than was
proposed by the Bill, in order that money should also be
borrowed to free the bridges."[<a id="chap04fn17text"></a><a href="#chap04fn17">17</a>]
</p>

<p>
Lord Derby's administration, under which Labouchere
had become one of the Liberal members for Middlesex, was
succeeded by the first administration of Mr. Disraeli.  In
December, 1868, the General Election took place, by which
Mr. Gladstone, in his turn, was put, for the first time, at the
head of Queen Victoria's Government.  Mr. Labouchere
presented himself for re-election at Middlesex in November.
It was at first thought that both the sitting members, himself
and Lord Enfield, would have a quiet "walk-over."  The
Conservatives, however, were determined to put forward at
least one candidate, and they selected Lord George Hamilton,
the third son of the Duke of Abercorn.
</p>

<p>
On November 2, both Henry Labouchere and Lord
Enfield issued their addresses, Lord Enfield appealing to his
electors on grounds no more vital than that he had
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P86"></a>86}</span>
represented Middlesex in Parliament for the last eleven years, and
Mr. Labouchere because he frankly avowed himself in
favour of the disestablishment of the Anglican Church in
Ireland as being likely to strengthen the establishment of the
Church of England in the sister isle, and, to quote verbatim
from his speech: "I shall," he said, "oppose the proposal
which was made last year by the Government of Mr. Disraeli
to endow a Roman Catholic university.  While I
respect the sincere convictions of my Roman Catholic
countrymen and desire that their religious convictions should
not subject them either to civil or political disqualification,
I do not think that their Church or their educational
establishments should have any portion of the revenues now
enjoyed by the established Church."  He went on to say:
"Since a Conservative Government has been in power the
public departments have vied with each other in
extravagance.  The efforts of private members in which I have
joined have proved ineffectual to check the waste.  The
sooner Mr. Gladstone is in office the better for the taxpayer."[<a id="chap04fn18text"></a><a href="#chap04fn18">18</a>]
</p>

<p>
The two Liberal candidates made public speeches to their
electors on the same day that they issued their addresses.
Labouchere made his in the British Schools at Brentford, and
the points on which he argued were the disestablishment of
the Irish Church and the waste of public money.  The
selection of Lord George Hamilton as the Conservative
candidate gave him an opportunity of making some extremely
annoying remarks.  He referred to him as "a young gentleman
who had lately joined the army&mdash;an unfledged ensign
who was getting on with the goose step and preparing himself
for the onerous duties connected with the Horse Guards,"
and other taunting remarks of a similar nature.
</p>

<p>
The embryo M.P., on November 9, stung to madness
by Labouchere's witticisms, boldly announced himself as his
opponent in particular.  He hotly denied that his father had
received annually for many years a large sum of money from
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P87"></a>87}</span>
the State and then had been made a duke for his kindness in
having accepted it.  The Conservative meeting at which the
young guardsman spoke would have been a decided political
success had it not been for the zeal of the gentleman who
seconded the vote of confidence.  He remarked that, ever
since the day when King John had signed the Magna Charta,
the people of this country had been indebted to the
aristocracy for all the liberties enjoyed in the Empire.  Storms of
groans and hisses met his well-meant remark, and though
the vote of confidence was passed, the show of hands was
manifestly against it.[<a id="chap04fn19text"></a><a href="#chap04fn19">19</a>]
</p>

<p>
But the real interest of the election was centred in the
personal quarrel between the Liberal candidates, which
resulted in a Tory being returned for Middlesex.  They
appeared each to be possessed with an ungovernable hatred
for the other, which was extremely prejudicial to their cause.
The occasion of their public rupture was a dispute over the
selection of electioneering agents, and by November 12 the
attitude of the belligerents had become so extremely abusive
that an important conference of Liberals from all parts of
Middlesex had to be convened to consider the disunited state
of their interest, more especially as it related to the relative
bearing of the candidates towards each other.
</p>

<p>
Whereupon Labouchere and Enfield each addressed a
public meeting and gave their separate versions of the
quarrel.  The delight of the Tories was excessive, and they
did all they could to foment the affair.  The <i>Times</i> rose to
unaccustomed heights of irony in a leading article occasioned
by the following not exactly conciliatory letter addressed by
Labouchere to its editor:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
SIR,&mdash;In the interests of the party Lord Enfield and I would
do well to adjourn the discussion of all personal differences until
after the Election.  Lord Enfield had distinctly refused to unite
before those differences arose; our discussion therefore has
nothing to do with our political disunion.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P88"></a>88}</span>
</p>

<p class="quote">
The constituency wish our union, I wish it too&mdash;but
personal relations need not be renewed.  Lord Enfield considers
himself and Lord George Hamilton to be what he is pleased to
call "scions of a noble stock."  I am a man of the middle class.
He considers himself my superior.  Let us agree to differ on this
point.&mdash;Yours truly,
</p>

<p class="quote">
HENRY LABOUCHERE.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"It is fortunate," remarked the <i>Times</i>, "that the Liberal
majority bids fair to be a large one, for otherwise the future
historians of Great Britain might have a somewhat
undignified episode to narrate in the electioneering contest of
1868, between the two great parties of the State.  If the
Liberals and the Conservatives happened to be running
each other so closely that one seat more or less might
determine the policy of the new Parliament, the Middlesex
election would probably have an odd part to play in British
annals.  Every reader of Liberal imagination can easily
conjure up for himself a picture of the calamities that might,
under evil stars, overtake this country if the Liberals found
themselves not strong enough to carry out their present
programme, and the Irish Church were left still standing,
with Ireland, as the natural result of so much anxious and
fruitless agitation, more discontented than ever.  Let him
then suppose that all these imagined misfortunes had to be
borne in consequence of his party having lost a seat for
Middlesex, because Lord Enfield objects 'on personal
grounds' to Mr. Labouchere!  Lord Chesterfield has told us
that great events are really due to much smaller causes than
historians, with a duly jealous regard for the dignity of their
profession, dare admit.  The Liberal majority in the next
Parliament might, if it so happened, be lost and the
programme of national policy at a critical moment reversed
because Mr. Labouchere has called Lord Enfield 'a sneak,'
and Lord Enfield objects to Mr. Labouchere's want of blue
blood!  We doubt whether Gibbon himself could give the
proper professional air of historical dignity to such an episode
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P89"></a>89}</span>
in the decline and fall of Great Britain as this.  According
to the first report of this squabble we read, Lord Enfield
distinctly refused to meet Mr. Labouchere, while
Mr. Labouchere, after showing that he had hitherto all along
conducted himself as a very model of meekness, bearing
endless snubs and rebuffs from his haughty adversary for the
public good, suddenly turned round and insisted that he
would 'fight single-handed' without any reference to his
brother Liberal.  It appears that, if the Liberals work
properly, the Conservative candidate, despite all the
advantages of high birth and impetuous youth, ought to be
beaten, but that otherwise he has a chance of success.  It
would be too bad if a Liberal seat were thus endangered,
and we trust Lord Enfield will accept Mr. Labouchere's
compromise, and console himself by reflecting that he can
still object as strenuously as ever to his plebeian adversary
in private."[<a id="chap04fn20text"></a><a href="#chap04fn20">20</a>]
</p>

<p>
Lord Enfield protested angrily in the next day's <i>Times</i>
against the accusation of having referred to himself as a
"scion of a noble house," and, oddly enough, his letter
appeared just below one sent to the paper by the Committee
of the Reform Club:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
THE REFORM CLUB, <i>Monday Evening</i>.
</p>

<p class="quote">
The Committee of the Reform Club having, in consequence
of the suggestions which have been made to them, taken into
consideration the differences between Lord Enfield and myself,
and having expressed an opinion that it is due to Lord Enfield
that I should withdraw certain offensive expressions which I used
concerning him, and that I should now express my regret for
having used them, and, as I am now informed by the Committee
that they have ascertained from Lord Enfield that he had no
intention of doubting my word, as I imagined he did, on the
occasion I referred to, I have no hesitation in at once acting on
the advice of the Committee.
</p>

<p class="quote">
H. LABOUCHERE.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P90"></a>90}</span>
</p>

<p>
A patch was thus temporarily placed over the breach, for
the benefit of the public, but the electors of Middlesex had no
delusions on the subject.
</p>

<p>
The meeting for the nomination of candidates at Brentford
was a rowdy affair, the proceedings being of a most
disorderly nature.  The re-election of Lord Enfield was
proposed and the proposition was received with groans and
hisses.  Then Labouchere's re-election was proposed.  At
that point the disorder became uncontrollable.  The
interruption had commenced with the appearance of a band of
roughs, wearing the Conservative card in their hats, who
began to hoot and groan at the Liberal speakers.  After this
had gone on for a few minutes, another band, not quite so
numerous, but of the same low class, poured into the square,
bearing the Liberal cards on their hats.  The two rival
factions severally hooted the speaker on the opposite side.
The roughs who were first in the field (the Conservatives had
engaged a band of a hundred roughs, seven of whom were
known to be prize-fighters) then began to hustle the others,
and had nearly borne them out of the square, when the police
made a charge upon them, but without using their staves, and
for a moment restored order.  The same disorderly conduct
was, however, renewed and several fights took place under
the eyes of the sheriffs.  The crowd swayed to and fro, and
the din and uproar was so continuous and incessant that the
rest of the proceedings had to be carried on in dumb show.
When the sheriff called for a show of hands for Lord Enfield
every hand on the right of a line drawn from the centre of the
hustings was held up.  For Mr. Labouchere about the same
number seemed to go up.  For Lord George Hamilton all the
hands on the left of the line went up.  The numbers seemed
pretty nearly divided.  It at first appeared that Mr. Labouchere
had the show of hands, and the sheriffs had, it was believed,
decided, or were about to decide, in his favour, when it
was pointed out to them that many Conservatives had held up
their hands for Lord Enfield, while, on the other hand, all the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P91"></a>91}</span>
Liberals had held up both their hands for Mr. Labouchere.
The sheriffs, after consultation, accordingly declared that
the show of hands was in favour of Lord Enfield and Lord
George Hamilton.
</p>

<p>
The election took place on November 24, and the result
of the poll was as follows:
</p>

<pre style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">
  Lord George Hamilton     7638 votes
  Lord Enfield                     6387   "
  Mr. Labouchere                6297   "
</pre>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Before the declaration of the poll, two cabs with placards
of "Plump for Enfield" were seen in the streets, which were
followed by others bearing "Plump for Labouchere."  This
was believed to have been a ruse of the enemy, but there were
some who thought it was a joke of Labouchere's.  He
however vehemently denied any knowledge of it.  There was
huge excitement at the official declaration of the poll.
Henry Labouchere, "the real Liberal candidate," as he was
called, had been met by his friends at Kew Bridge, who had
accompanied him to the meeting.  He was evidently the
favourite,[<a id="chap04fn21text"></a><a href="#chap04fn21">21</a>] and the populace took out his horses and insisted
upon dragging his carriage through the town.  Enfield was
hissed and hooted.  Labouchere made a dignified speech,
in which he referred to the practical disenfranchisement of
Middlesex, by its election of a Conservative and a Liberal,
and he insisted strongly and ably upon the necessity of
organisation in all electioneering work.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Labouchere published the following absurd reminiscence
of this election in an early number of <i>Truth</i>: "A
candidate knows very little of the details of his election, but,
so far as I could make out, dead men played a very important
part, on both sides, in this contest between Lord George and
me.  No sooner were the booths open than men long
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P92"></a>92}</span>
removed from party strife rose from their graves, and hurriedly
voted either for him or for me."[<a id="chap04fn22text"></a><a href="#chap04fn22">22</a>]
</p>

<p>
An amusing episode of the Middlesex election of 1868 was
the mistake which the supporters of Mr. Labouchere made
in mistaking Mr. Henry Irving for their defeated candidate.
Mr. Labouchere himself related the story some sixteen
years later, when there was a report current that the famous
actor was about to offer himself as a parliamentary candidate.
"Irving did once appear upon the hustings," he said,
"and it was in this wise.  I was the defeated candidate at a
Middlesex election.  Those were the days of hustings and
displays, and it was the fashion for each candidate to go
down to Brentford in a carriage and four to thank his
supporters.  On the morning of the day when I had to
perform this function, Irving called upon me, and I invited
him to accompany me.  Down we drove.  I made an inaudible
speech to a mob, and we re-entered our carriage to
return to London.  In a large constituency like Middlesex,
few know the candidates by sight.  Irving felt it his duty to
assume a <i>mine de circonstance</i>.  He folded his arms, pressed
his hat over his brows, and was every inch the baffled
politician&mdash;defeated, sad, but yet sternly resigned to his fate.  In
this character he was so impressive that the crowd came to
the conclusion that he was the defeated candidate.  So
woebegone, and so solemnly dignified, did he look that they were
overcome with emotion, and, to show their sympathy, they
took the horses out of the carriage and dragged it back to
London.  When they left us, I got up to thank them, but
this did not dispel the illusion.  'Poor fellow,' I heard
them say, as they watched Irving, 'his feelings are too much
for him,' and they patted him, shook hands with him, and
thanked him."[<a id="chap04fn23text"></a><a href="#chap04fn23">23</a>]
</p>

<p>
A <i>Times</i> leader of November 30 made the following
comments on the Middlesex election: "In Middlesex, the
minority has been allowed not only a representative, but a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P93"></a>93}</span>
place at the head of the poll, by the selection of two Liberal
candidates, almost avowedly in competition, and with some
unexplained circumstance of personal antagonism.  Though
it is likely enough many of the votes have been split between
the two successful candidates, it is evident on the face of the
return that a better selected pair of Liberal candidates might
have carried both seats.  Few persons will quarrel with a
result which gives one of the most important minorities in
the kingdom a voice in Parliament, but the result is a fluke
rather than the consequence of a sound intention or of a wise
provision of law."
</p>

<p>
At the General Election of 1874, Mr. Labouchere made
another attempt to enter the House of Commons.  He first
offered himself at Southwark, but, as he was one of six Liberal
candidates, he withdrew, and presented himself for election
at Nottingham.  At Nottingham also there was a superfluity
of Liberal candidates, but two of these, Mr. Labouchere
and Mr. Laycock, would probably have got in, had it not
been for the determined antagonism of Mr. Heath, the
Labour candidate, to Mr. Labouchere.  It was also asserted
by the leading Liberals of the place that the seats were lost,
because Mr. Labouchere's advanced Radicalism scandalised
the Liberal supporters.  Be that as it may, the result of
the election was that two Conservatives were returned for
Nottingham.  Mr. Labouchere was as usual philosophical
upon the subject of his unsuccessful election: "When one is
in," he said, "one wants to be out, and when one is out, one
wants to be in.  La Bruyère says that no married people
ever pass a week without wishing, at least once, that they
were unmarried, and so I suspect it is with most M.P.'s."
</p>

<p>
There were many amusing stories about Mr. Labouchere
current at this time.  One of the best that appeared in the
Nottingham papers during the election was the following:
"He went to a fancy dress ball in London, wearing diplomatic
uniform, and on presenting himself at the door, he
was refused admission by a policeman.  'Why?' said
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P94"></a>94}</span>
Mr. Labouchere.  'Because no one is allowed here in a
diplomatic uniform,' said the 'bobby.'  'Confound your
impudence,' growled the ex-member for Middlesex, 'I will
go in.'  'Not in diplomatic dress, no one's to pass here in
diplomatic togs,' repeated Mr. Bluebottle; 'my order is to
watch this door for that special purpose.'  'What's your
name, scoundrel?' yelled the financial editor of the <i>World</i>;
'my name is Labouchere, and I will enter.'  'And mine,'
rejoined the amateur policeman, 'is Lionel Brough.'  They
walked upstairs arm-in-arm together."

CHAPTER V
<br><br>
JOURNALISM AND THE STAGE
</h3>

<p class="t3">
(1864-1880)
</p>

<p>
After he had been unseated for Windsor, Mr. Labouchere
went abroad for some months, most of which
time he spent at Nice.  He also went to Florence, and was at
Homburg, in 1868, just before the General Election.  His
connection with journalism began at this period, as he sent
frequent letters to the <i>Daily News</i>, both from Nice and
Florence.  These were always remarkable for their pithiness
and wit, although he had by no means developed the style
which he brought to perfection two years later as "The
Besieged Resident," and which made his fame as a journalist.
In 1868, he became part proprietor of the <i>Daily News</i>, which
it was decided to issue for the future as a penny paper.[<a id="chap05fn1text"></a><a href="#chap05fn1">1</a>]  Sir
John Robinson thus describes the syndicate of which
Mr. Labouchere became a member: "The proprietors of the
<i>Daily News</i>, a small syndicate which never exceeded ten
men, were a mixed body, hardly any two of whom had
anything in common.  The supreme control in the ultimate
resort rested with three of them, Mr. Henry Oppenheim, the
well-known financier, with politics of no very decided kind;
Mr. Arnold Morley, a Right Honourable, an ex-party Whip,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P96"></a>96}</span>
and a typical ministerial Liberal; and Mr. Labouchere, the
Radical, financier, freelance.  Others had but a small holding,
and practically did not count, save as regards any moral
influence they might bring to bear on their colleagues at

The new editor selected for the penny <i>Daily News</i> was
Mr. Frank Hill, but the paper was run at a loss until the
winter of 1870, when the special war news published in its
columns caused the circulation to increase in one week from
50,000 to 150,000.  Mr. Robinson, its far-seeing manager,
attributed the success of the paper, at this period, first, to the
excellence of his correspondents, and secondly, to his having
insisted upon having the whole of his news telegraphed to
London, instead of being transmitted by the post.  The
number of the correspondents on the staff of the <i>Daily News</i>
during the war was seventeen, of which the chief was
Mr. Archibald Forbes, who may be rightly described as a prince
among journalists.  Henry Labouchere too had the main
<i>heureuse</i> where newspapers were concerned.  His Paris
letters were eagerly read all over the civilised world, the
excitement and interest created by them being even more
vehement in America than in London.  The fortune of the
<i>Daily News</i> was made,[<a id="chap05fn3text"></a><a href="#chap05fn3">3</a>] and from then onwards for many
years the great organ of Liberalism grew and flourished.
When Mr. Labouchere sold his share[<a id="chap05fn4text"></a><a href="#chap05fn4">4</a>] in 1895 he did so at a
large profit.  As I shall not have occasion to return again to
Mr. Labouchere's financial connection with the <i>Daily News</i>,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P97"></a>97}</span>
I shall give in this place an account Mr. Lionel Robinson
recently wrote to me of the transaction: "So many contradictory
statements have been put forward in the press with
reference to the late Mr. Labouchere's pecuniary interest in
the <i>Daily News</i>, that you may not be unwilling to find space
for the recollections of one who heard at the time, and
subsequently, various versions of the story.  My own impression,
derived from personal intercourse, is that some time about
1868 or a little later, Mr. Labouchere purchased a quarter
share in the newspaper for about £14,000, and further, that
the vendor was Mr. Henry Rawson of Manchester.  I do
not pretend to know what were the annual profits of the
paper, beyond the fact that they increased enormously
during the twenty years dating from the Austro-Prussian
War and its subsequent developments.  It was, therefore,
not surprising that when Mr. Labouchere decided to sell his
share in the paper it should have commanded a high price.
I have heard it, from a certain distance of time from the
event, placed as high as £92,000, but my personal recollection
is that the sum mentioned by Mr. Labouchere was
£62,000 or thereabouts."
</p>

<p>
In one of Mr. Labouchere's letters from Nice to the
<i>Daily News</i> he gave a characteristic account of some of his
compatriots abroad.  The following quotation from it will
show the reader that, if he had not yet acquired the style of
his later work, the spirit of it was very active&mdash;the spirit
which made him hate mediocrity and pretentiousness:
"Here, as in almost every foreign watering-place, there is a
colony of English Bohemians, who live among themselves,
give each other tea parties and such mild festivities, frequent
charity and other public balls, abuse each other and every
one else, pet the English clergyman or denounce his doctrines,
worry their Consul with every kind of complaint and
requirement, and keep up a gallant and hopeless struggle to
penetrate into foreign society.  As most of them only speak
their own language, as the men, who, no doubt, have many
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P98"></a>98}</span>
solid virtues, are devoid of the art of pleasing in a mixed
society, and the women, pillars as they are of virtue, have
little of the Siren about them, foreign society does not
respond to their advances."[<a id="chap05fn5text"></a><a href="#chap05fn5">5</a>]
</p>

<p>
Labouchere was not so successful over his speculation in
theatre property.  In the October of 1867, Messrs. Telbin
and Moore did up the New Queen's Theatre, formerly
St. Martin's Hall, in Long Acre, and it was opened under the
management of Mr. Alfred Wigan, one of the most
accomplished comedians of the day.  Mr. Alfred Wigan had a
mysterious partner in management, and Herman Merivale,
who had written a most successful farce, as the curtain
raiser for the new theatre, gives a charming little account of
his discovery of the identity of the mysterious personage.
Alfred Wigan soon wanted some melodrama for the theatre,
and Merivale wrote a play.  Wigan told him that he must
submit it to his partner.  "Two or three days afterwards,"
writes Merivale, "I was sent in fear and trembling to the
manager's room at the Queen's, to meet the mysterious
partner.  I was introduced, and, sitting at the table with a
cigarette in his mouth, I saw Labouchere.  'Good Lord!' he
said, 'are <i>you</i> the eminent author?'  'Heavens!' quoth I,
'are <i>you</i> the mysterious partner?'
</p>

<p>
"Both of us had carefully concealed our hidden sin at the
dinner party.[<a id="chap05fn6text"></a><a href="#chap05fn6">6</a>]  What struck me most was a small array of
bills of the new play hung all round, each printed with a
different title, that the mysterious partner might see which
looked best.  It was, at all events, bold expenditure.  <i>Time
and the Hour</i> was the title that the authors[<a id="chap05fn7text"></a><a href="#chap05fn7">7</a>] had hit upon;
and Labouchere decided that it should be chosen.  'It's
a splendid title, I think,' he said.  'Delighted that you
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P99"></a>99}</span>
say so,' was my flattered answer.  'It really is, you know.
Do for any play whatever that ever was written.'"[<a id="chap05fn8text"></a><a href="#chap05fn8">8</a>]
</p>

<p>
<i>Time and the Hour</i>, as it turned out, was, in its way, a kind
of curiosity.  For the cast comprised, besides Wigan himself,
a whole bouquet of coming managers, some of whom were at
the beginning of their professional careers.  There were
J. L. Toole, Lionel Brough, John Clayton, and Charles Wyndham.
Other plays acted at the Queen's Theatre under
Mr. Labouchere's management were Tom Taylor's <i>Twixt Axe and
Crown</i>, and H. J. Byron's <i>Dearer than Life</i>.  In the former
the lovely Mrs. Wybert Rousby flashed for the first time in
her full beauty on the London stage, and in the latter the
cast included Henry Irving, J. L. Toole, John Clayton,
Lionel Brough, and Charles Wyndham, and last, but most
important of all, as Lucy, that clever artist and fascinating
personality, Henrietta Hodson, who afterwards became Mrs.
Labouchere.  Another star at the Queen's Theatre, during
the first year of Mr. Labouchere's management, was Ellen
Terry.  She thus describes herself playing there in the
<i>Double Marriage</i>.  "As Rose de Beaurepaire," she writes,
"I wore a white muslin Directoire dress and looked absurdly
young.  There was one curtain which used to convulse
Wyndham.  He had a line, 'Whose child is this?' and there
was I looking a mere child myself, and with a bad cold in my
head too, answering: 'It's <i>bine</i>!'  The very thought of it
used to send us off into fits of laughter."[<a id="chap05fn9text"></a><a href="#chap05fn9">9</a>]
</p>

<p>
A contemporary picture of Mr. Labouchere at this time is
given by Mr. George Augustus Sala, in his <i>Life and
Adventures</i>.  Mr. Labouchere had begged Sala to write him a play,
full of exciting situations.  "An appointment was made with
him," said Sala, "to meet Halliday (another dramatic
author) and myself at ten o'clock one evening at the Queen's
Theatre.  He was then one of the members for the County of
Middlesex.  He struck me as being in all respects a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P100"></a>100}</span>
remarkable man, full of varied knowledge, full withal of humorous
anecdotes, and with a mother wit very pleasant to listen to.
His conversation was to me additionally interesting, because,
when I was in Mexico, I had gone over most of the ground
which he had travelled."
</p>

<p>
The first numbers of <i>Truth</i> abound with news of the
Queen's Theatre, and the unvarnished accounts Mr. Labouchere
gave of the contretemps that occurred during his
management, and the strange, unexpected things that
happened, possibly contributed to the lack of consideration
he experienced as a theatrical manager.  Here is part of an
article devoted to the art of the stage, published during the
first year of <i>Truth</i>: "The play on which I lost most was an
adaptation of <i>The Last Days of Pompeii</i>.  Everything went
wrong in this piece.  I wanted to have&mdash;after the manner of
the ancients&mdash;acrobats dancing on the tight rope over the
heads of the guests at a feast.  The guests, however,
absolutely declined to be danced over.  Only one acrobat made
his appearance.  A rope was stretched for him, behind the
revellers, and I trusted to stage illusion for the rest.  The
acrobat was a stout negro.  Instead of lightly tripping it
upon his rope, he moved about like an elephant, and finally
fell off his rope, like a stricken buffalo.  In the second act
the head of a statue was to fall off, and to crush Mr. Ryder,
who was a magician.  There was a man inside the statue,
whose mission was to push over its head.  With folded arms
and stern air, Mr. Ryder gazed at the statue, awaiting the
portentous event that was to crush him to the earth,
notwithstanding the mystic power that he wielded.  The head
remained firm on its neck.  The man inside had solaced
himself with so much beer, that he was drunk and incapable,
and Mr. Ryder had, much to the amazement of the audience,
to knock down the head that was to crush him.  In the third
act the stage represented a Roman amphitheatre.  In the
midst of a gorgeously dressed crowd sat Mr. Ryder.  'Bring
forth the lion!' he said.  The audience thrilled at the idea
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P101"></a>101}</span>
of a real lion being marched on to the stage.  Now I had no
lion, and I had discarded the idea of putting a lion skin on a
donkey.  An attendant therefore walked in and said, 'Sir,
the lion will not come.'  Those of the audience who were
not hissing, roared with laughter.  The last act was to
represent the eruption of Vesuvius and the destruction of
Pompeii.  The mountain had only been painted just in time
for the 'first night.'  I had never seen it.  What was my
horror when the curtain rose upon a temple with a sort of
large sugar loaf behind it.  At first I could not imagine what
was the meaning of this sugar loaf.  But when it proceeded to
emit crackers I found that it was <i>Vesuvius</i>!"[<a id="chap05fn10text"></a><a href="#chap05fn10">10</a>]
</p>

<p>
Sometimes he let the theatre, and on that subject he was
almost pathetic: "Whenever this theatre is to let," he
wrote, "I am complimented by numerous persons with
proposals which prove that I am regarded by them as the
most credulous and confiding of human beings&mdash;hardly
indeed a human being, but a simple, convenient lamb
... nothing that I can do convinces them that I am not a lamb
covered with nice long wool and eager to be shorn.  On these
occasions I remember that the tempering of the wind to the
shorn lamb is, after all, but a poetical figure, and therefore
I take care to meet the tempest with a fleece on my back."[<a id="chap05fn11text"></a><a href="#chap05fn11">11</a>]  He
had not a high opinion of dramatic artists, as men of
business.  "I confess," he said, "that for my own part I
have never understood the meaning of high art in its dignified
aspect.  I never, in the course of my existence, came across
one of its votaries&mdash;painter, sculptor, author, or architect&mdash;who
was ready to sacrifice one farthing of his own at its
shrine.  I once was the owner of a theatre, and I was
perpetually at war with authors and actors who wanted me to
ruin myself on the altar of high art, but I soon found that
this was a term which they used for their own fads.  Once I
produced a play by Charles Reade.  It was a failure, and
on the first night I was sitting with him in a box.  'They
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P102"></a>102}</span>
seem to be hissing, Mr. Reade,' I said.  'What of that?' he
replied; 'if you want to please such a public as this, you
should not come to me for a play.'"[<a id="chap05fn12text"></a><a href="#chap05fn12">12</a>]  He had an amusing
story too to relate of how he rode roughshod over Tom
Taylor's artistic prejudices by insisting upon a chemical fire
being lit upon the stage at his production of the latter's <i>Joan
of Arc</i>, in the flames of which the heroine (Mrs. Rousby) was
to perish realistically, instead of being wafted to Heaven in
the arms of angels, as the author had planned she should be.
But the story of his theatre-management days that he was
fondest of telling was in connection with the late Sir Henry
Irving.  The latter, at a big banquet he gave to a party of his
friends, was relating some of the events of his professional
career.  "And to think, Labby," he said, turning to his old
friend, "that I was once receiving five pounds a week from
you!"  "Three pounds, Henry, my boy," retorted
Labouchere quickly, "only three."
</p>

<p>
He professed the greatest contempt, and considering the
financial failure of his management of the Queen's Theatre,
perhaps naturally so, for those stingy votaries of pleasure
who were always cadging him for orders for his theatre.
"Theirs," he said, "is the meanest, most sneaky and
contemptible form of beggary."  But he got the better of one
of these beggars.  One day his tailor asked him for an order.
He sent it to him, but the next morning he sent the tailor an
"order" entitling the bearer to a new suit of clothes.  The
tailor, realising the tit for tat, sensibly complied with the
request, but ever afterwards bought his tickets for the
"Queen's" in the conventional manner.  Another set of
persons who encountered his righteous wrath in his theatre
days were the would-be dramatic authors.  He described
how hundreds of worthless plays were sent him, resembling,
in their incoherence and lack of perspective, the crude pencil
drawings of infants.  He gave in <i>Truth</i> the opening of one of
them, further than which, he explained, he did not read:
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P103"></a>103}</span>
"The broad Mississippi is seen rolling its turbid flood towards
the ocean, and carrying with it the debris of a village.
Steamers come and go on its surface.  On a frail raft a man
and a woman are crossing the river.  Enter the negroes
from a plantation monotonously singing."[<a id="chap05fn13text"></a><a href="#chap05fn13">13</a>]
</p>

<p>
He attributed the failure of his own adaptation of
Sardou's <i>La Patrie</i> to the narrow powers of appreciation
possessed by Londoners.  "They fancy," he wrote, "that no
drama or melodrama can be good, which does not conform
to certain rules.  The heroine must be the purest and the
best of her sex; she must engage in a struggle with adverse
circumstances, and with bad men; and she must emerge, in
the last act, triumphant.  The audience, in fact, must leave
the theatre, not only pleased with her acting, but with her.
Now, the heroine of <i>Fatherland</i> is Dolores, and the plot turns
upon her betrayal of her husband.  This was fatal to the
success of the play, but it is an open question whether it
ought to have been fatal to it.  Conventionalism is the bane
of advance in art."
</p>

<p>
All things considered, it was not surprising that
Mr. Labouchere's proprietorship of the Queen's Theatre was a
financial failure.  Joseph Hatton gives a curious description
of the way in which Mr. Labouchere managed the business,
the facts of which he got from the same personal interview
already quoted: "Sometimes he brought out plays himself.
He generally lost by them, but now and then had a success.
Occasionally in the preparations for a new production he
would go abroad.  When particularly wanted by the management,
he could not be found.  The work went on, however,
all the same, and so did the loss.  Once he was advised to
cram the house for a week with orders, so that nobody could
get in.  The traditional 'Full' was posted at all the
entrances.  He did this on condition that, after a week, every
one should be compelled to pay.  When the second week
came the house was empty.  Then the actors complained.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P104"></a>104}</span>
They could not act to empty benches.  'Why don't you
draw?' was Labouchere's reply to their grievance.
'Draw! confound it!  Why don't you draw?'  He announced
Shakespearean revivals, proposing to produce one new play
of the bard's in splendid style every year.  Notices were put
up at all the entrances, inviting the audiences to vote on the
piece.  For a long time he worked up quite an excitement by
posting up the result of the voting.  'This was a capital
idea; it increased the number who paid at the door
immensely.'  Nevertheless the Queen's did not prove a
success, and it has lately been converted into a co-operative
store."[<a id="chap05fn14text"></a><a href="#chap05fn14">14</a>]
</p>

<p>
At every period of his life, Mr. Labouchere displayed all
the happiest characteristics of the Bohemian, or, what comes
to the same thing, the instincts of the real aristocrat.  He was
comfortably at home in whatever social milieu he happened
to find himself&mdash;a camp of nomadic Indians, a Court ball, a
rowdy hustings, the manager's room of a London theatre,
the <i>vie intime</i> of a royal country house, or the bourgeois
domesticity of a thrifty German home&mdash;and he was welcomed
and appreciated in every one of them&mdash;except by the prigs
and the bores.
</p>

<p>
He knew his London well.  "I have lived in London
many years.  I have known the seamy side of London life for
far more than a quarter of a century, and am familiar with
every detail of the 'old days' as they are called.  I can
compare the present with the past, decency with disgust,
order with license, and remember the time when we supped
in a cellar under the Portico, where the Pall Mall restaurant
now stands, when the Haymarket cafés were open as long as
customers patronised them.  I can recall the nights when
Panton Street and Jermyn Street were lined with watchmen
and confederates, and admittance was only gained to certain
favoured meeting-places by giving a sign, or peeping through
a slit in the door or guichet....  I have seen a Chancellor
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P105"></a>105}</span>
and a Cabinet Minister watching with amused gaze a scene,
which was at least decorous on the surface, at the Argyll
Rooms in Windmill Street, and, listening to excellent music,
I have sat unnoticed up in the corner of the old Holborn
Casino, where the Holborn restaurant now stands.  I have
seen some wild scenes at the Foley Street rooms (Mott's)
in the early hours of the morning, and hideous scenes at 222
Piccadilly&mdash;the 'Pic' as it was then called&mdash;since pulled
down and destroyed for the now palatial Criterion.  In the
warm summer nights I have driven down to Cremorne, and
wandered there till the daylight, in lilac and purple, came out
above the tall trees and put out the yellow glare of the gas.
I have even condescended to the decorous dissipation of
Caldwell's dancing rooms, beloved by milliners, and now
turned into a National School.  I have been an eye-witness
of the ups and downs of London life, and the so-called
humours of the West End.  I have observed the contest
between common-sense and prudery, between the men of
liberal mind and those determined to make the vicious
virtuous by Act of Parliament.  I have lived through the
changes of licensing rules and closing hours, and seen one
place of amusement after another shut up and confiscated&mdash;the
decorous tarred with the same brush as the dirty.
Cremorne and the Holborn Casino bombarded equally with
Mott's and the Piccadilly Saloon,..." he wrote in the
course of an article, which ended with one of the most
powerful indictments of British virtue ever published,[<a id="chap05fn15text"></a><a href="#chap05fn15">15</a>] and
it was during the sixteen years that elapsed between his
departure from the Diplomatic Service and his entrance to
the House as the "Christian" member for Northampton
that he acquired most of his vast experimental knowledge
of the artistic and vagabond side of human nature about
town.
</p>

<p>
He was close upon fifty when he entered upon his serious
Parliamentary life, which was, as all who knew him well are
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P106"></a>106}</span>
aware, but a phase, though an important one, in his
extraordinarily varied career.  Three episodes stand out with
clearness, apart from his abortive electioneering experiences
already described, in the years between 1864 and his first
Northampton election&mdash;his residence in Paris throughout the
siege, his connection with the <i>World</i>, as its financial editor,
and his founding of his own weekly publication, <i>Truth</i>.  The
first of these is described in a separate chapter, and so, with
equal necessity, is the third.  For an account of how he came
to be on the staff of the World we must go to the <i>Recollections</i>
of the late Mr. Edmund Yates himself, who relates that,
previous to launching the first number of his journal upon
the public, he had issued a very original prospectus.  "I had
also sent a prospectus to Mr. Henry Labouchere," he
continued, "with whom I had a slight acquaintance, and whose
services as a literary freelance might, I thought, be utilised.
Some days after, I saw Mr. Labouchere on the Cup Day at
Ascot, seated on the box of a coach.  I asked him if he had
heard from me, and he said, 'Oh, yes,' adding that he
'thought the prospectus very funny.'  'But,' I said, 'will
you help us in carrying it out&mdash;will you be one of us?'  'You
don't mean to say,' he replied, 'that you actually
mean to start a paper of the kind set forth?'  I told him
most assuredly we did, and that we wanted his assistance.
He laughed more than ever, and said he would let me know
about it.  A few days after, I heard from him, proposing to
write a series of city articles, which he actually commenced
in the second number."
</p>

<p>
Labouchere's preliminary article in the <i>World</i>[<a id="chap05fn16text"></a><a href="#chap05fn16">16</a>] was
extremely droll.  It began as follows: "Some years ago,
Mr. John F. Walker, having derived a considerable fortune from
cheating at cards in Mississippi steamboats, determined to
enjoy his well-earned gains in his native city of New York,
and purchased an excellent house in that metropolis.  In
order to add to his income he advertised that he was a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P107"></a>107}</span>
'reformed gambler,' and, for a consideration, would instruct
novices in all the tricks of his trade.  Mr. Walker was
universally esteemed by his fellow-citizens, and died last
year, greatly regretted by a numerous body of friends and
admirers.  In casting about for the city editor for our
journal, we have fallen upon a gentleman, who, by promoting
rotten companies, puffing worthless stock, and other
disreputable, but strictly legal, devices, has earned a modest
competence.  He resides in a villa at Clapham, he attends
church every Sunday with exemplary regularity, and is the
centre of a most respectable circle of friends; many of his old
associates still keep up their acquaintance with him, and therefore
he is in a position to know all that passes in the city.  This
reformed speculator we have engaged to write our city article."
</p>

<p>
The staff of writers selected by Mr. Yates for the first
year of the <i>World</i> was a singularly efficient one.  It
comprised, besides Mr. Labouchere, Mr. T. H. S. Escott,
Dr. Birkbeck Hill, Lord Winchelsea (who contributed articles on
racing and turf matters), M. Camilla Barrère, Mrs. Lynn
Linton, Mr. F. I. Scudamore, Mr. Archibald Forbes, and
Mr. Henry Lucy (who commenced, in the eighth number, his
series of Parliamentary Sketches, "Under the Clock").  But,
in spite of the excellent writers engaged on its production,
the <i>World</i> did not sell well.  Again it was the <i>main heureuse</i>
of Henry Labouchere that gave the necessary push to make
the new weekly go.  Mr. Yates writes as follows:
"Mr. Labouchere was dealing with City matters in a way which
they had never been dealt with before, and ruthlessly
attacking and denouncing Mr. Sampson, the city editor of the
<i>Times</i>, whose position and virtue had hitherto been considered
impregnable.  All these features ... received due
appreciation from our provincial <i>confrères</i>, and the 'trade,'
but, as yet, they seemed to have made no impression on the
public.  We were in the desperate condition of having a good
article to sell without the power of making that fact known.
At last, and just in the nick of time, we obtained the requisite
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P108"></a>108}</span>
public notice, and without paying anything for it.  A
stockbroker, a member of the Stock Exchange, who conceived
himself likely to be attacked for certain practices by
Mr. Labouchere in the city article, threatened to horsewhip that
gentleman, should such observations appear, and Mr. Labouchere
had the would-be assailant brought before the Lord
Mayor for threatening to commit a breach of the peace.
The case was really a trivial one, and it was settled by the
defendant being bound over in sureties for good behaviour.
But it had been argued at full length, each side being
represented by eminent lawyers; Mr. Thesiger, Q.C., appeared
for the defendant and Mr. (afterwards Sir) George Lewis for
Mr. Labouchere.  A great deal was said about the <i>World</i>,
and its determination to purge Capel Court of all engaged in
iniquitous dealings.  All that was said was reported at
length in the daily papers.  The effect was instantaneous;
the circulation rose at once, and the next week showed a very
large increase of advertisements."
</p>

<p>
The case, as Mr. Yates says, was a trivial one, but
remarkable for Mr. Labouchere's irresistibly funny way of
giving evidence.  It was tried on October 14, 1874, at the
Guild Hall, and in answer to the Lord Mayor, he gave the
most absurd account of the assault as it occurred:
</p>

<p>
"'I said to him (Mr. Abbott): "I presume that if you were
attacked in a newspaper unfairly, you would bring an action
for libel, and if you won it you would get heavy damages."  He
replied: "I should not go into Court; I know what
newspapers want; they always want to go into Court, it is a fine
advertisement for them.  I should horsewhip the man."  "Well,"
I said, "under the circumstances, the observation
is a personal one, and I reply to you, in the words of
Dr. Johnson, 'I shall not be deterred from unmasking a scoundrel
by the menaces of a ruffian.'"  He then said he presumed
I meant this for him, or something of that sort.  I said,
"Well, it looks like it.  You were just now talking about
horsewhipping; why don't you begin?"'
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P109"></a>109}</span>
</p>

<p>
"<i>Mr. Thesiger</i>: 'In that tone of voice?'
</p>

<p>
"'Very much like that,' drawled on Mr. Labouchere.
'He then stared at me, and I repeated: "Well, why don't
you begin?"  I don't know what his object was, but he
rolled himself about and threw up his hands.  I presume
he intended to frighten me by an exhibition of what he
imagined to be a pugilistic attitude more than anything
else.  I again said: "Why do you not begin?"  He then hit
me a blow."
</p>

<p>
"Have you any fear of Mr. Abbott?" asked Mr. Lewis,
later on in the proceedings.  "Well, no," replied
Mr. Labouchere.  "When I was at Spezia, I used to bathe a good
deal in the Gulf and there were a quantity of porpoises&mdash;"  But
what Mr. Abbott's behaviour had to with porpoises,
was never revealed to the Court, for, in spite of the hisses of
the audience, who wanted to hear the end of Mr. Labouchere's
story, Mr. Thesiger interrupted, saying sharply:
"This is really making a farce of a Court of Justice."
</p>

<p>
"I am a calculator, not a speculator," was one of Labouchere's
retorts to Mr. Thesiger.  "A distinction," said Mr. Thesiger,
when summing up for his client, "that Mr. Labouchere
will be able to explain to his own satisfaction, but
perhaps not to that of other people."
</p>

Mr. Grenville Murray was another able writer on the staff
of the <i>World</i>, and was for some time Mr. Yates's partner in
the proprietorship of the paper, but the partnership was
dissolved because Mr. Yates disapproved of Murray's repeated
attacks upon Lord Derby.  It would have been well if
Mr. Labouchere had been as prudent as Mr. Yates.  When
Mr. Labouchere started <i>Truth</i>, he persuaded Mr. Grenville
Murray to write some of his "Queer Stories," and it was one
of these that brought upon the editor of <i>Truth</i> the wrath,
never to be assuaged, of a very important personage.
Mr. Labouchere told me once that, by some accident, he never
saw the "Queer Story" in question, until it had actually
appeared in print.  Had he done so, he should never have
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P110"></a>110}</span>
permitted its publication.  Reference had already been
made to Mr. Labouchere's somewhat imprudent championship
of the ex-Consul of Odessa, but, when it was asserted
in a much-read weekly that Mr. Labouchere was the proprietor
of the Queen's <i>Messenger</i>,[<a id="chap05fn17text"></a><a href="#chap05fn17">17</a>] he was obliged to send the
following letter to the <i>Times</i>:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
2 BOLTON STREET, July 5, 1869.
</p>

<p class="quote">
SIR,&mdash;Having been informed that the proprietorship of the
<i>Queen's Messenger</i> has been attributed to me by a weekly
newspaper, I shall be much obliged to you to allow me a space in your
columns to deny the statement.  I have not, and never had,
directly or indirectly, anything to do with the <i>Queen's Messenger</i>.
</p>

<p class="quote">
HENRY LABOUCHERE.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
An old member of the staff of the <i>World</i>, in a recently
published article commenting upon certain unintentional
misstatements of a definite nature that had appeared from time
to time in the press in connection with the two gifted editors
respectively of the <i>World</i> and <i>Truth</i>, said, after dealing with
one relating to Mr. Labouchere's supposed partnership with
Mr. Yates: "Equally contrary to fact is the statement, even
more generally made and accepted, that Mr. Labouchere
severed his connection with the <i>World</i>, and founded <i>Truth</i>,
as the sequel of personal differences between himself and his
sometime editor.  No such personal differences occurred at
any period; and, though Yates would have been more than
human if he had rejoiced at the decision of a particularly
able member of his staff to leave him, in order to start another
journal, planned on parallel lines and appealing to the same
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P111"></a>111}</span>
public, he was far too shrewd a man of the world to show any
sense of grievance or resentment.  It happened that the
news of Mr. Labouchere's project first reached his editor's
ears through the medium of a third person; and on being
challenged by Yates, as to the truth of the rumour, the
imperturbable 'Labby' characteristically replied that he
had decided for the future to have a pair of boots of his own
with which to do his own kicking.  Rivals, in a journalistic
sense, as they thenceforth necessarily became, the friendly
personal relations between the two were maintained to the
last, and the weekly mutual corrections of 'Henry' by
'Edmund' and vice versa, which caused so much diversion
to the readers of both papers, were conducted at all times in
an entirely amicable spirit."[<a id="chap05fn18text"></a><a href="#chap05fn18">18</a>]
</p>

<p>
Mr. Montesquieu Bellew, another journalist of that time,
was an <i>intime</i> of Mr. Labouchere's.  On the occasion of
Mr. Bellew's son choosing the stage as his profession, Mr. Labouchere
took the opportunity of writing in <i>Truth</i> a racy article,
in which he related the whole story of his friendship and
travels in company with this most unconventional parson.
They must indeed have been a queer pair, and it is interesting
to imagine the effect they must have produced together
at the various <i>tables d'hôte</i> and social functions they attended
on their journey.  They became acquainted in this wise.
Mr. Labouchere was idling one day on the steps of his hotel
at Venice, when he noticed a gentleman paying his bill and
tipping the porters preparatory to taking his departure.  His
carriage was waiting for him at the door.  "Where are you
going?" said Mr. Labouchere, on the impulse of the moment.
"To the Holy Land," replied the stranger.  "Wait five
minutes," replied Labouchere, "and I will come with you."  He
flew to his room and flung his clothes into his portmanteau
and joined Mr. Bellew, who was waiting for him.  He did not,
however, discover the identity of his travelling companion
until they reached Jerusalem, although he knew that he was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P112"></a>112}</span>
a clergyman, because every night before retiring to rest
Mr. Bellew pressed a manuscript sermon into his hand, for
"night-reading."  At Jerusalem, Mr. Bellew broke to him that, his
bishop being in the place, he should probably be asked to
preach in the English Church.  Labouchere took this as a
hint that Mr. Bellew would like him to be present, so he made
his plans accordingly.  Finding out at what precise moment
of the service the sermon would begin, he marched into the
church with great impressiveness, at the head of a large band
of Arabs and others, whom he had bribed to accompany him.
This, he explained afterwards to Bellew, was to create in the
bishop's mind the impression that Bellew was such a prodigy
of piety that even the inhabitants of the country places of
Syria had heard of his fame and were come in flocks to gaze
upon him.  The bishop's annoyance on the occasion he
assured Bellew was entirely due to his jealousy of his more
popular <i>confrère</i>.  They quarrelled on the journey.  Bellew
pointed out to Labouchere a small stream.  "That," he said,
"is the source of the Jordan."  Labouchere pointed out
another stream, declaring that that and that alone was the
source of the Jordan.  They argued the matter hotly, but
Labouchere was not aware how deeply Bellew had taken the
affair to heart, until he found himself in bed that night with
no manuscript sermon under his pillow.  But Bellew was a
Christian and a man of tact.  The next day in the course of
their wanderings, they came upon another minute trickle of
water.  "That," said Bellew, with a note of conciliation in his
voice, "is the source of the Jordan; we were both in the wrong
yesterday."  "Of course it is," assented Labouchere; "how
in the world we came to make such a mistake I can't
imagine."  From Jerusalem they went on to the Dead Sea.
Bellew had picturesque-looking long white hair, which he
would comb and arrange before a looking-glass that accompanied
him on all his travels.  This looking-glass got upon
Labouchere's nerves, so one day "I got hold of it," he related,
"and sent it to join Sodom and Gomorrah beneath the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P113"></a>113}</span>
gloomy waters that stretched out beneath us.  The next
night, we pitched our tent in the desert.  Dire was the
confusion on rising.  The looking-glass could not be found.
I held my tongue respecting its fate.  Probably some day or
another some eminent explorer, poking about the bottom of
the Dead Sea, will fish up this looking-glass, and we shall have
archæologists divided in opinion, one half proving that it
belonged to a lady of Sodom and the other half that it was
the property of a gentleman of Gomorrah.  Bellew was equal
to the occasion.  He managed to arrange his hair by looking
into the back of a dessert spoon."[<a id="chap05fn19text"></a><a href="#chap05fn19">19</a>]  Mr. Bellew contributed
a most interesting account of his journey to the East in the
first number of <i>Temple Bar</i> called "Over Babylon to
Baalbeck."[<a id="chap05fn20text"></a><a href="#chap05fn20">20</a>]  He does not, however, mention in it his
travelling companion, nor any of the incidents referred to by
Mr. Labouchere in his account of the same journey.  Mr. Bellew
subsequently joined the Church of Rome, and died in 1874.
On one of Mr. Labouchere's frequent visits to Italy, he
met Dumas <i>père</i>, with whom he had an amusing adventure.
Strolling into a restaurant at Genoa for breakfast, he perceived
Dumas at another table, and, seated by his side, a very
pretty girl, dressed like a Circassian boy, young enough to be
Dumas's granddaughter.  To continue the story in his own
words: "Dumas told me that they had just landed from a
yacht and were spending the day in Genoa.  He introduced
the girl to me as Emile.  After luncheon he proposed that we
should all take a carriage, and go and see a show villa in the
neighbourhood.  When we reached the villa, we were told
that it was not open to the public on that day.  'Inform your
master,' said Dumas to the servant, 'that Alexandre Dumas
is at his door.'  The servant returned, and told us that we
could enter.  We were ushered into a dining-room, presenting
a typically Italian domestic scene.  The father and
mother of the family were present, and several well-grown
boys and girls.  Dumas was somewhat taken aback for a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P114"></a>114}</span>
moment, but introduced Emile and me vaguely as '<i>mes
enfants</i>.'  As we were asked to sit down to coffee we made
ourselves at home.  Afterwards the owner showed us his
garden.  He and Dumas walked first.  Emile and I wandered
about hand-in-hand to denote our brotherly and sisterly
affection.  The Circassian was in a playful mood, and told
me that Dumas was of a jealous disposition, which grandfathers
sometimes are.  He had one eye on the beauties of
the garden and the other on his children.  'What are you
doing?' said Dumas.  I replied that I was embracing my
sister.  As he could not well object to this, for once, I think,
I got the better of the lady's eminent grandfather."  He had
a story too of the younger Dumas.  Labouchere was at the
wedding of Mlle. Maria Dumas, and her brother, on coming
to the sacristy with all the family friends for the signature of
the register, looked at the document for a minute, as if
perusing it carefully, and then said with mock gravity, "The
accused have nothing further to add for their defence?  Be it
so!"  And then he signed.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Labouchere's curiosity at this period of his life was
insatiable.  He wanted to know what it felt like to be a
criminal about to be hanged.  So, having procured an
invitation to see all over Newgate, he carried out his
experiment, and described his sensations in the columns of the
<i>Daily News</i>.  After giving a vivid account of the prison and
some of its inmates, he wrote the following realistic lines:
"And now we were led through a long stone passage open to
the sky.  This was the Newgate graveyard.  Beneath each
flag is the corpse of a murderer, and on the walls opposite are
their initials, which have been cut by the warders to guide
them through this murderous labyrinth.  At the other end of
the passage is the execution yard.  The scaffold is put up the
night before an execution, in a corner close by the door through
which the condemned prisoner issues.  The court is surrounded
by high gloomy walls, and looks like the ante-chamber
of Hades.  I asked the warder whether in his opinion murderers
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P115"></a>115}</span>
preferred being executed in public or private.  He opined
the former.  'The crowd keeps them up,' he said.  'They
are not so firm, now it takes place in private.'  I understand
this feeling.  If I were going to be hanged myself I should
like the ceremony to take place <i>coram populo</i>.  I should feel
myself already dead in that dreary yard; and I should
prefer, I imagine, after weeks or months of prison life, to
have one more look at the world, even though that world
were a howling mob, before quitting it for ever.
</p>

<p>
"We passed through the chapel and were shown the
chair on which the prisoners condemned to death are
perched&mdash;in obedience to what seems to me a barbarous custom&mdash;to
hear their last sermon, and then we entered the 'Press
Room.'  It is a room of moderate size with plain deal
tables, benches, and cupboards.  One of these latter the
warder opened, and showed us Jack Sheppard's chains, and
other interesting relics, which are as religiously preserved as
though they had belonged to saints.  A leather sort of
harness was also brought out.  It consisted of two belts
with straps attached to the lower one for the wrists.  This
is the murderer's last dress, and with it round him he walks
to the scaffold.  I tried it on, and when my hands were
buckled to my side, I pictured to myself my sensations if
I had been waiting to fall into the procession to the
neighbouring yard.  I heard my funeral bell toll; I saw the
ordinary by my side; the warders telling me that my time was
up; Calcraft bustling about eager to begin.  So strong was
the impression that I hastened to get out of the prison, and
was not fully convinced that I was not going to be hanged
until I found myself in the midst of a crowd in Fleet Street,
who, for reasons best known to themselves, were cheering
the 'Claimant,' who was issuing from a shop, while a chimney
sweep who was passing by was welcomed as Bogle, being
mistaken for that dusky retainer."[<a id="chap05fn21text"></a><a href="#chap05fn21">21</a>]
</p>

<p>
With reference to the "Claimant," Mr. George Augustus
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P116"></a>116}</span>
Sala has a curious story to relate about him and Mr. Labouchere,
who, of course, took the greatest interest in the famous
trial.  "I saw a great deal of the Claimant during 1872,"
says Mr. Sala, "and I remember once dining with him and
the late Mr. Serjeant Ballantine at the house of Mr. Labouchere,
who then resided in Bolton Street, Piccadilly.  The
senior member for Northampton had, upon occasion, a
curious way of putting things; and over the walnuts and
the wine&mdash;of which our host was not a partaker&mdash;he startled
us all by coolly asking his obese guest, 'Are you Arthur
Orton?'  'Good Heavens, Mr. Labouchere,' exclaimed the
stout litigant, 'what do you mean?'  'Oh, nothing in particular,'
quoth Mr. Labouchere; 'help yourself to some more
claret.'"[<a id="chap05fn22text"></a><a href="#chap05fn22">22</a>]
</p>

<p>
Mr. Labouchere however afterwards was quite convinced
that the Claimant was not Orton.  When the latter was
released from penal servitude in 1884, he published the
following reminiscence:
</p>

<p>
"It is a curious fact that during his trial the London
papers sold more copies than during the Franco-Prussian
War, or any other recent eventful epoch.  I confess that
it never was proved absolutely to my mind that he was
Arthur Orton; on the other hand, whilst there was the
strongest presumption that he was, he entirely failed to make
out that he was Sir Roger Tichborne.  I remember once
during the trial, in company with Mr. G. A. Sala, passing
an evening with the 'stout nobleman' at his hotel in Jermyn
Street.  We found him very pleasant, and he told us many
tales of his existence in Australia.  He certainly had a
wonderful command over his features.  On that last day
of the civil trial, the room at the hotel was filled with
adherents, many of whom were Tichborne bondholders.  Suddenly
the Claimant walked in.  He leant against the mantelpiece,
took his cigar out of his mouth, and announced the fatal
news.  Great was the excitement, great was the despair and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P117"></a>117}</span>
the indignation.  But the Claimant calmly smoked on,
apparently the only person in the room who had no sort of
interest in the matter."[<a id="chap05fn23text"></a><a href="#chap05fn23">23</a>]
</p>

<p>
Soon after Mr. Labouchere's founding of <i>Truth</i>, he
became involved in several lawsuits, the most famous of
which, at this period, was the one which indirectly led to
his expulsion from the Beefsteak Club.  He invariably
commented with great wit and asperity upon his enemies,
frustrated and otherwise, in the columns of his paper, and
there is no doubt that its enormous popularity depended
in large degree upon the fearlessness and unconventionality
with which he attacked all persons of high degree and
low, guilty of injustice, bullying, <i>snobisme</i>, or wilfully
ignorant prejudice, who, for long, had been silently endured by
their weaker brethren, for no other reason than because
there had never before been a&mdash;Labby.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes he was accused by an envious press of being
a liar.  The title he had chosen for his paper possibly
provoked the criticism.  He was rather sensitive on the subject,
and expressed a certain amount of annoyance whenever the
well-known ditty of Sir Henry Bridges, "Labby in our
Abbey," which was published in M. A. P., was mentioned.[<a id="chap05fn24text"></a><a href="#chap05fn24">24</a>]  In
<i>Truth</i> he once produced what may be called an apposite
alibi when confronted by the accusation.  Some correspondent
had referred rather pointedly to the existence of Lying
Clubs in the last century.  "There is no occasion to go back
to the last century to prove the existence of Lying Clubs,"
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P118"></a>118}</span>
he wrote.  "When I was at Bishop-Auckland in County
Durham, a few years ago, I found a Lying Club existing and
flourishing.  There were different grades of proficiency.  If
a man could not lie at all, he was expelled.  If he lied rather
badly, he was given another trial.  I never knew any one
expelled.  I was blackballed."

CHAPTER VI
<br><br>
THE BESIEGED RESIDENT
</h3>

<p class="t3">
(Sept., 1870-Feb., 1871)
</p>

<p>
Mr. Labouchere was a famous raconteur and of the
reminiscences he loved to recount there was no more
riveting a series than the one relating his experiences as a
journalist during the siege of Paris.  According to the
<i>Times</i>[<a id="chap06fn1text"></a><a href="#chap06fn1">1</a>] nothing that he ever achieved in journalism or
literature excelled or perhaps equalled the letters of a
"Besieged Resident," which he sent from Paris to the <i>Daily
News</i>, in the autumn and winter of 1870 and 1871.  The
correspondent of the <i>Daily News</i> in Paris at that period was
the late Mr. George Morland Crawford, who had occupied
the position since 1851.  Mr. Crawford had already made
Mr. Labouchere's acquaintance in the early sixties, when
the latter was an attaché at Frankfort, and they had met
again later on at Homburg.  It had been the intention of
Mr. Crawford to remain at his post in Paris, when an
unexpected offer from Henry Labouchere to replace him
temporarily caused him to alter his plans.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Crawford has given a graphic account[<a id="chap06fn2text"></a><a href="#chap06fn2">2</a>] of how
Labouchere took her husband's place as correspondent.
He had been in Paris with the exception of some excursions
into the country for several weeks, and had invited
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P120"></a>120}</span>
Mr. Crawford to dine with him at Durand's on the night of
September 17.  The party was to have included Aurélien
Scholl, celebrated then as a wit, Got of the Comédie Française,
Dr. Alan Herbert, and Mr. Frank Lawley.  However, the
uncertainty of immediate events and the general rush of
departure from the capital obliged Labouchere to put off
his party.  He went at about six o'clock to the Café du
Vaudeville to find Mr. Crawford&mdash;first to tell him that the
dinner was countermanded, and then to propose to take his
place as correspondent in Paris, whilst he, Mr. Crawford,
should go to Tours.  Mrs. Crawford happened to be with
her husband at the café, and she thus describes the impression
Labouchere made upon her:
</p>

<p>
"Labby looked a young man on this, to me, memorable
evening, but, at the close of the siege, frightened Odo Russell
by looking almost an old one.  Before my husband, who was
writing, introduced us he began to talk to me and I could
not make him out, but at once enjoyed his company.  He
had a very pleasing and intelligent face, I thought spoke a
little like an American (he had been escorting a party of
American young ladies to Rouen), had high caste manners,
but with naturalness, and much that was the reverse of that
affectation of owlish wisdom or cordial dodgery then rife
in the diplomatic world.  I saw that he was somebody,
both on his own account, and from education, and thought
that he might be some Don brought up in England, who had
made himself the president of a South American Republic."
</p>

<p>
As soon as Mr. Crawford had finished his writing,
Labouchere broached the subject of the <i>Daily News</i>.  He said:
"A fancy seized me, as Sheffield (of the British Embassy)
told me you had sent your little children to England, and
your wife had resolved to stay through the siege and give
you what help she can.  It is to take your place as
correspondent of the <i>Daily News</i>, and to send you into the
provinces.  As I am a proprietor of the paper, Robinson won't
object to this arrangement.  It would be an excellent thing
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P121"></a>121}</span>
for my heirs were I to stop a bullet or die of starvation, but
were anything of the sort to befall you it would be calamitous
for you and yours.  You need not leave me the six weeks'
provisions which Sheffield told me you laid in, but can give
them to poor neighbours.  I can always get as much fresh
mutton as I want from the porter of the British Embassy,
who has orders to this effect.  There is a flock of ewes and
wethers on the grounds there, to browse on the grass and eat
the hay laid in for the horses of Lord Lyons, before he had
directions from Granville to go to Tours to watch events
there.  The only person at the Embassy is the porter.  We
two will have more mutton than we can eat even if the siege
lasts long.  The porter knows how to grow potatoes and
mushrooms in an empty cellar, so that we two shall have not
only meat but dainties to vary the dishes.  I have arranged to
have rooms at the Grand Hotel, so you see I shall be in
clover."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Crawford, who did not the least believe he was in
earnest, protested that she was not at all afraid of remaining
in Paris, but Labouchere persisted in his persuasions.
</p>

<p>
"If you were at all affected," he replied, "I should say,
'Don't be theatrical.'  Instead of that I shall say, 'Don't
be like Lot's wife.'"  Then he took out his watch and
explained that the last train to leave Paris between then and
the end of the siege would start from the Gare St. Lazare
that night at 9.40.  "I advise you to go home at once," he
went on, "and pack up what clothes you can for your
temporary residence at the seat of the delegate government at
Tours.  Lyons will be glad to have you near him, for, as
you can understand, he knows nothing personally of those
friends of yours whom the Revolution has brought to the
top."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Crawford lost no more time in discussion, and hurried
off to make her preparations in order to catch the last
train by which she and her husband could get out of Paris.
The 9.40 train did not leave St. Lazare that day before
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P122"></a>122}</span>
midnight, and such was its weight of passengers and baggage
that no fewer than three engines had to be coupled on.
</p>

<p>
The next day Mr. Labouchere sent his first letter to
London, in his capacity of Paris correspondent to the <i>Daily
News</i>.  The mails continued to leave Paris regularly for
another three days, but the chaos that prevailed in the
post-office did not inspire the citizens who entrusted their
correspondence to its tender care with overmuch confidence.
</p>

<p>
"Everybody was in military uniform," writes Labouchere,
"everybody was shrugging his shoulders, and everybody was
in the condition of a London policeman, were he to see
himself marched off to prison by a street sweeper.  That the
Prussians should have taken the Emperor prisoner and
have vanquished the French armies, had of course astonished
these French bureaucrats, but that they should have
ventured to interfere with postmen had perfectly dumbfounded
them."  Having disposed of his letter as best he might,
Labouchere passed through the courtyard to try his luck
with a telegram.  There he saw postmen seated on the boxes
of carts, with no horses before them.  It was their hour to
carry out the letters, and thus mechanically they fulfilled
their duty.  It is in touches such as these that the writer
makes the scenes of the winter months of '70 and '71 live
before the eyes of his readers.  Were the ridiculous episodes
he relates visible to others besides himself, or were his
journalistic abilities so acutely developed that nothing
significant, however minute, could escape his eager scrutiny?
It is not easy to say, but the fact remains that he gave the
world at that time, in astonishingly amusing letters, vivid
pictures of bureaucracy startled into ludicrous attitudes
of unaccustomed enterprise, of gilt and tinsel patriotism
ineffectually trying to replace the paper courage[<a id="chap06fn3text"></a><a href="#chap06fn3">3</a>] of Imperial
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P123"></a>123}</span>
France&mdash;of an irresponsible populace brought face to face
with a catastrophe which they imagined to be impossible
up till within the last ten days of the siege.
</p>

<p>
The Parisians had undoubtedly a good excuse for the
poor figure they were obliged to cut before Europe in the
January of 1871.  Events, which every one, except their
ex-Emperor and his government, had predicted as inevitable,
had followed one another with a disastrous rapidity, leaving
them, after each one, <i>bouches béantes</i>, incapable of deciding
whether the most appropriate gesture to express their
attitude would be one of applause, of hisses, or of weeping.
</p>

<p>
Only six months had elapsed since the afternoon of the
Emperor's reception, at St. Cloud, of the members of the
Senate, when M. Rouher had said, during the course of his
address, in words that, to-day, sound as if they must have
been meant to be ironical: "Your Majesty has occupied the
last four years in perfecting the armament and organisation
of the army," and since the King of Prussia and the
Sovereigns of South Germany had ordered the mobilisation
of their armies.  Six months!  But what a six months of
bloodshed and fury, of humiliation and defeat.
</p>

<p>
The Emperor left St. Cloud for the seat of war on July
28th, and went straight to Metz, where a Council of War
was held on August 4, with Marshals Macmahon and
Bazaine in attendance.  That very day the Crown Prince
of Prussia fell upon a portion of Macmahon's army corps at
Weissenburg, and all but destroyed it, killing its general,
Abel Douay, and taking 800 prisoners.  The next day a
similar fate overtook another corps, commanded by
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P124"></a>124}</span>
Macmahon himself on the hills above Wörth, when 6000 men
were killed or taken prisoner, and no less than thirty pieces
of artillery with six mitrailleuses were captured.  Whilst
the latter engagement was actually in progress General
Froissard's army corps, which was holding the heights above
Saarbrück, was driven back in confusion and with great
loss upon Metz.
</p>

<p>
The news of these events fell upon the ears of startled
Europe on August 8.  A fiasco, so hurried and hopeless,
had not been contemplated.  At first a false report had
reached Paris of a grand victory won by Macmahon, who
was supposed to have captured the Crown Prince of Prussia
with all his army.  The enthusiastic excitement had been
unbounded.  Gradually the truth was borne in upon the
unhappy people, and a hopeless reaction was the natural
result.  Napoleon's apologetic telegrams from Metz did not
cheer his subjects; even the fourth of a series of five containing
these words, <i>Tout pent se rétablir</i>, brought little hope to
their hearts, for it was impossible not to be aware of the fact
that, although the war was but three weeks old, the Prussian
invasion of France was going successfully and steadily
forward.
</p>

<p>
But France was still an Empire, and, on the morning of
August 7, the Empress-Regent presided over a ministerial
council at 5 o'clock in the morning, and convoked the chambers,
who met on the 9th, when the Ollivier Ministry resigned.
The department of the Seine was declared in a state of siege,
and a permanent council of the Ministry was established at
the Tuileries.  The Ollivier Ministry was replaced, by one
under Count Palikao.
</p>

<p>
It was still possible for news of the French defeats at the
seat of war to reach the capital.  Bazaine's unsuccessful
movement of retreat from Metz to Verdun on August 15,
followed by the bloody battle of Gravelotte, resulting in his
enforced retirement into the entrenched camp of Metz,
spread further consternation among the Imperial Ministers
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P125"></a>125}</span>
at home, and preparations for a siege began in earnest.
General Trochu was appointed Commander-in-Chief of all
the forces in Paris on August 17.
</p>

<p>
Sedan was fought on the first of September, and on the
second, the Emperor of the French sent his sword to the
King of Prussia, who thereupon appointed him a residence
as a prisoner of war.  Two days later the advance guard of
the Prussian army at Sedan set out for Paris.
</p>

<p>
It is to the columns of the <i>Daily News</i>,[<a id="chap06fn4text"></a><a href="#chap06fn4">4</a>] that we must
turn for the most authentic account of the way in which
Paris took the news of Sedan.  Although Labouchere was
not yet the official correspondent from Paris, he nevertheless
sent letters to Fleet Street dealing with matters connected
with the crisis, which were published above the signature of
a "Parisian Resident."
</p>

<p>
"The news of the Emperor's capture," he writes on
September 4, "reached the foreign embassies here at ten
yesterday morning.  At about 8 o'clock it began to be
rumoured that the Emperor and Macmahon's army had
surrendered.  I saw a crowd of about 2000 men going down
the Boulevard, and shouting '<i>La déchéance</i>.'  I took the
arm of a patriot, and we all went together to the Louvre to
interview General Trochu.  He came out after we had
shouted for him about half-an-hour, and a deputation had
gone in to him.  There was a dead silence as soon as he
appeared, so what he said could be distinctly heard.  He told
us that the news of the capture of the Emperor was true,
and that as for arms he could not give more than he had,
and he regretted to say that the millions on paper were not
forthcoming."
</p>

<p>
In the course of the next twenty-four hours a bloodless
revolution was accomplished in Paris.  On Sunday afternoon
Labouchere got into a carriage and drove about the
city, noting everything he saw.  "The weather was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P126"></a>126}</span>
beautiful," he wrote; "it was one of the most glorious early
September days ever seen.  I drove slowly along the quay
parallel with the Orangerie of the Tuileries before the Palace.
The Tuileries gardens were full of people.  I learned that,
in the morning, orders had been given to close the gates,
but that, half-an-hour before I passed, the people had forced
them open, and that neither the troops nor the people made
any resistance.  My coachman, who, I dare say, was an
Imperialist yesterday, but was a very strong Republican
to-day, pointed out to me several groups of people bearing
red flags.  I told him that the tricolour, betokening the
presence of the Empress, still floated from the central tower
of the Tuileries.  While I was speaking, and at exactly
twenty minutes past three, I saw that flag taken down.
That is an event in a man's life not to be forgotten.
Crossing over the Pont de Solferino to the Quai d'Orsay, I
witnessed an extraordinary sight indeed.  From the windows
of those great barracks, formerly peopled with troops, every
man of whom was supposed to be ready to die for his Emperor,
I saw soldiers smiling, waving handkerchiefs, and responding
to the cries of '<i>Vive la République</i>.'  Nay, strangers fell on
each other's necks and kissed each other with 'effusion.'  In
the neighbourhood of the Pont Neuf, I saw people on the
tops of ladders busily pulling down the Emperor's bust,
which the late loyalty of the people had induced them to
stick about in all possible and impossible places.  I saw the
busts carried in mock procession to the parapets of the Pont
Neuf and thrown into the Seine, clapping of hands and hearty
laughter greeting the splash which the graven image of the
mighty monarch made in the water.  I went as far as the
Hôtel de Ville, and found it in possession of his Majesty the
Sovereign People.  Blouses were in every one of M. Haussmann's
balconies.  How they got there I do not know.  I
presume that M. Chevreau did not invite them.  But they
got in somehow without violence.  The great square in
front of the Hôtel de Ville was full of the National Guards,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P127"></a>127}</span>
most of them without uniform.  They carried the butts of
their muskets in the air, in token that they were fraternising
with the people.  The most perfect good humour prevailed.
Portraits of the Emperor and Empress, which many of your
readers must have seen in the Hôtel de Ville ballrooms,
were thrown out of the window and the people trod and
danced on the canvas.  On leaving the Hôtel de Ville I
saw, in the Avenue Victoria, M. Henri Rochefort,[<a id="chap06fn5text"></a><a href="#chap06fn5">5</a>] let out of
prison as a logical sequence of events but half-an-hour
before.  He was on a triumphal car, and wore a scarlet
scarf.  He was escorted by an immense mob, crying, '<i>Vive
Rochefort</i>!'  He looked in far better health than I expected
to see him after his long imprisonment, and his countenance
beamed with delight.  He had seen his desire on his enemy."

<br>
Facsimile of a &quot;Pigeon-post&quot; letter sent by Henry Labouchere to his mother during the siege of Paris.
</p>

<p>
At four o'clock on the same day the Republic was
proclaimed at the Hôtel de Ville, with a provisional Government
composed of the following members: MM. Gambetta, Jules
Favre, Pelletan, Rochefort, Jules Ferry, Jules Simon, and
Ernest Picard.  Kératry was appointed Prefect of the Police
and Arago the Mayor of Paris.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the Prussians came nearer and nearer.  On
the 10th, they entered Laon, and General Hame, who was
in command, surrendered the citadel in order to save the
city.  On that day the Republican Government issued an
order to all owners of provisions and forage in the
neighbourhood to move their goods into the capital.  On the 18th
the Crown Prince and the third army were at Chaumes, and
two days later the long march of the Prussians was ended.
The Crown Prince took up his headquarters at Versailles.
The <i>Daily News</i> correspondent, Archibald Forbes, who had
accompanied the third army from Wörth to Sedan, and from
Sedan to Paris, informed Fleet Street that: "The fortune
of war has brought the Prussians to the Hampton Court
of the French capital&mdash;has placed them at the very gates of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P128"></a>128}</span>
Paris.  I need say no further word to make the situation
more striking.  Here are the dark blue uniforms and the
spiked helmets in the stately avenues of Versailles.  The
barracks of the Imperial Guard give ample quarters to King
William's soldiery, and there have been found immense
stores of hay and oats which will make the Prussian horses
fat, if only rest enough be given them for feeding."
</p>

<p>
From that day until the end of the siege no regular mail
went out of Paris.  Balloons and pigeons carried the news
of the imprisoned inhabitants into the provinces and beyond
the seas.  Sometimes a letter would be successfully fixed
between the double soles of a crafty man's boots,[<a id="chap06fn6text"></a><a href="#chap06fn6">6</a>] who would,
on some pretext or another, succeed in making his way
through the Prussian lines, or a note would be rolled up
into a ball and be concealed in a pot of pomade and so
proceed in unctuous quiet on its way out of the prison into
the open.  Henry Labouchere, some twenty-five years later,
described how he managed to get his letters to the <i>Daily
News</i>.[<a id="chap06fn7text"></a><a href="#chap06fn7">7</a>]
</p>

<p>
"More of my letters reached their destination, I believe,
than those of other correspondents.  The reason was this.
The correspondents waited on Jules Favre, and asked him
to afford them facilities for sending their letters.  He kindly
said that he would, and told us that whenever a balloon
started we might give them, made up in a parcel, to the man
in charge, who would make it his business to transmit them
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P129"></a>129}</span>
to their destination so soon as the balloon touched land
outside.  There was a complacent smile on his countenance
when we gratefully accepted this offer that led me to suspect
that, whatever might happen to the letters, they were not
likely to reach the newspaper offices to which they were
addressed, unless they lauded everything.  So, instead of
falling a victim to this confidence trick, I placed my letters
under cover to a friend in London, and put them into a
post-box, calculating that, as each balloon took out about twenty
thousand letters, those posted in the ordinary way would
not be opened."
</p>

<p>
The letters, posted as Labouchere described above, were
written on tissue paper and addressed to Miss Henrietta
Hodson.  She, immediately on receipt of the manuscript,
carried it to Fleet Street, where it was rightly considered
copy of the very first order.
</p>

<p>
Labouchere, as soon as the siege had really begun, tried
in vain to induce General Trochu to allow him to accompany
him on his rides to the ramparts of the city, pointing out
that the newspaper correspondents were always allowed to
accompany the Prussian staffs.  Trochu would not hear of
the scheme, and explained that he himself had been within
an inch of being shot because he had had the impudence to
say that he was the Governor of Paris.
</p>

<p>
"From Trochu," writes Labouchere, on September 25,
"I went to pay a few calls.  I found every one engaged in
measuring the distance from the Prussian batteries to his
particular house.  One friend I found seated in a cellar with
a quantity of mattresses over it, to make it bomb-proof.
He emerged from his subterraneous Patmos to talk to me,
ordered his servant to pile on a few more mattresses, and then
retreated.  Anything so dull as existence here it is difficult
to imagine.  Before the day is out one gets sick and tired
of the one single topic of conversation.  We are like the
people at Cremorne waiting for the fireworks to begin; and
I really do believe that if this continues much longer, the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P130"></a>130}</span>
most cowardly will welcome the bombs as a relief from the
oppressive <i>ennui</i>."
</p>

<p>
A letter to his mother,[<a id="chap06fn8text"></a><a href="#chap06fn8">8</a>] dated September 26, gives the
following account of his life in Paris: "I wrote a day or two
ago by balloon, but probably my letter is in the moon.  A
man is going to try and get through the lines with this, and
a letter to the <i>Daily News</i>.  We are all right here.  The
Prussians fire at the forts, but as yet they have not
bombarded the town.  Provisions are already very dear.  It is
rather dull&mdash;in fact a little bombarding would be a relief to
our <i>ennui</i>.  Everybody is swaggering about in uniform.
I went round the inner barricades a day or two ago with the
citizen Rochefort."
</p>

<p>
A few days later he wrote to the <i>Daily News</i>: "The
presence of the Prussians at the gates, and the sound of the
cannon, have at last sobered this frivolous people.  Frenchmen
indeed cannot live without exaggeration, and for the
last twenty-four hours they have taken to walking about as
if they were guests at their own funerals.  It is hardly in
their line to play the <i>justum et tenacem</i> of Horace.  Always
acting, they are now acting the part of Spartans.  It is
somewhat amusing to see the stern gloom on the face of
patriots one meets, who were singing and shouting a few
days ago&mdash;more particularly as it is by no means difficult
to distinguish beneath this outward gloom a certain keen
relish, founded upon the feeling that the part is being well
played."
</p>

<p>
On the evening of the same day Labouchere took his
strolls abroad, and came to the Avenue de L'Impératrice,
where he found a large crowd gazing upon the Fort of Mont
Valérien.  This fort, from being the strongest for defence,
was particularly beloved by the Parisians.  "They love it
as a sailor loves his ship," writes Labouchere.  He witnessed
the following incident: "If I were near enough," said a young
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P131"></a>131}</span>
girl, "I would kiss it."  "Let me carry your kiss to it,"
responded a Mobile, and the pair embraced, amid the cheers
of the people around them.
</p>

<p>
The question of domestic economy had not yet become
a pressing one, as far as the "besieged resident" was
concerned.  He was lodged <i>au quatrième</i> at the Grand Hotel,
and wrote during the first week of the siege: "I presume if the
siege lasts long enough, dogs, rats, and cats will be tariffed.
I have got a thousand francs with me.  It is impossible to
draw upon England; consequently, I see a moment coming
when, unless rats are reasonable, I shall not be able to afford
myself the luxury of one oftener than once a week."  And a
fortnight later he writes: "My landlord presents me every
week with my bill.  The ceremony seems to please him,
and does me no harm.  I have pasted upon my mantelpiece
the decree of the Government adjourning payment of rent,
and the right to read and re-read this document is all that
he will get from me until the end of the siege.  Yesterday
I ordered myself a warm suit of clothes; I chose a tailor with
a German name, so I feel convinced he will not venture to
ask for payment under the present circumstances, and if he
does he will not get it.  If my funds run out before the siege
is over, I shall have at least the pleasure to think that this
has not been caused by improvidence."
</p>

<p>
He wrote to his mother on October 10, as follows: "I
send this by balloon.  The smaller the letter, the more
chance it has to go.  We are all thriving in here, though we
have heard absolutely nothing from the outside world for a
fortnight.  I don't know if my letters to the <i>Daily News</i>
arrive.  Yesterday, I could only get sheeps' trotters and
pickled cauliflower for dinner.  We boast awfully of what
we are going to do, but, as yet, all our sorties have been
driven back, and our forts stun our ears by firing upon stray
rabbits and Uhlans.  If ever my letters to the <i>Daily News</i>
do not arrive and come back here, I shall be shot, but I
don't think that they will.  I am convinced that the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P132"></a>132}</span>
provisions will soon give out.  We go about saying that we
cannot be beaten, because we have made a 'pact with
death.'"
</p>

<p>
And again on the 21st: "We are getting on very well here.
Nothing has come in since the commencement of the siege,
and no one can get out.  They say there are provisions to
last until February, so we shall have a dose of our own society.
About one sixth of the town is now commanded by the
Prussian batteries, but we don't know whether they will
fire or not.  I am living very well on horse and cat&mdash;the
latter excellent&mdash;like rabbit, only better.  Our people brag
very much, but do little more.  The Ultras are going
ahead&mdash;they have taken now to denouncing crucifixes, which they
call ridiculous nudities&mdash;a mayor has had them all removed&mdash;he
then announced that no marriages were to take place in
his <i>arrondissement</i>&mdash;marriage being an insult upon honourable
citizens who did not approve of this relic of superstition.
This was a little too much, so he was removed, and we are
now free to marry or not according to our tastes.  I am
the intimate friend of Louis Blanc, so no one touches me."
</p>

<p>
One of the most curious things about these letters by
balloon was the irregularity in their delivery.  It was not
merely that one balloon reached friendly or neutral territory
in safety, while another did not.  Of half a dozen letters
coming by the same balloon, two would be delivered, say,
on the 6th of the month, one on the 10th, two on the 15th,
and the last on the 20th.  This greatly puzzled the recipients
at the time.  The explanation turned out to be that the
bag containing the first letter had been sent off immediately
the aeronaut descended, whereas the others underwent a
variety of adventures.  Frequently a balloon fell at or
near a place of German occupation.  The aeronaut would
come down at a run, hurry off with one bag, and give the
others to friendly peasants, who secreted them until an
opportunity occurred for getting them safely to the nearest
post-town.  Usually the letters came in beautiful order,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P133"></a>133}</span>
without a speck upon them to show an unusual mode of
transit.  One batch, however, had to be fished out of the
sea, off the Cornish coast.  In one case a letter was delivered
in wonderfully quick time.  Dispatched from Paris on a
Monday night, it was delivered in London on the following
evening.[<a id="chap06fn9text"></a><a href="#chap06fn9">9</a>]
</p>

<p>
Apparently his "made in Germany" suit did not wear
as well as might have been expected, for it was only December
when he described his wardrobe as follows:

"My pea-jacket is torn and threadbare, my trousers are
frayed at the bottom, and of many colours&mdash;like Joseph's
coat.  As for my linen, I will only say that the washer-women
have struck work, as they have no fuel.  I believe
my shirt was once white, but I am not sure.  I invested a
few weeks ago in a pair of cheap boots.  They are my
torment.  They have split in various places, and I wear a pair
of gaiters&mdash;purple, like those of a respectable ecclesiastic&mdash;to
cover the rents.  I bought them on the Boulevard, and
at the same stall I bought a bright blue handkerchief which
was going cheap; this I wear round my neck.  My upper
man resembles that of a dog-stealer, my lower man that of a
bishop.  My buttons are turning my hair grey.  When I
had more than one change of raiment these appendages
remained in their places, now they drop off as though I were
a moulting fowl.  I have to pin myself together elaborately,
and whenever I want to get anything out of my pocket, I
have cautiously to unpin myself, with the dread of falling
to pieces before my eyes."

In another place Labouchere describes his head-dress,
which was quite eccentric enough to fit in with the rest of his
travesty: "I have bought myself a sugar-loaf hat of the
first Republic, and am consequently regarded with deference.
'The style is the man,' said Buffon; had he lived here now
he would rather have said, 'The hat is the man.'  An English
doctor who goes about in a regulation chimney-pot has
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P134"></a>134}</span>
already been arrested twenty-seven times.  I, thanks to my
revolutionary hat, have not been arrested once.  I have
only to glance from under its brim at any one for him to
quail."
</p>

<p>
The extracts which Labouchere copied from the newspapers
for the benefit of his London readers are extremely
amusing, and give, as no other method of narration could
have done, a good idea of the spirit which the leaders of the
people thought fit to try and promulgate amongst the
Parisians.  One morning, for instance, he learned that "Moltke
is dead, that the Crown Prince is dying of a fever, that
Bismarck is anxious to negotiate but is prevented by the
obstinacy of the King, that three hundred Prussians from
the Polish provinces have come over to our side, that the
Bavarian and Würtemberg troops are in a state of incipient
rebellion.  From the fact that the Prussian outposts have
withdrawn to a greater distance from the forts, it is probable
that they despair of success, and in a few days will raise the
siege.  Most of the newspapers make merry over the faults
in grammar in a letter which has been discovered from the
Empress to the Emperor, although I doubt whether there
is one Frenchman in the world who could write Spanish as
well as the Empress does French."
</p>

<p>
The New Year's address to the Prussians, published in
the <i>Gaulois</i>, is a masterpiece of journalistic invective, and
the relish with which the besieged resident copied it for the
benefit of his London readers may well be imagined:
</p>

<p>
"You Prussian beggars, you Prussian scoundrels, you
bandits and you Vandals, you have taken everything from
us; you have ruined us; you are starving us; you are
bombarding us; and we have a right to hate you with a royal
hatred.  Well, perhaps one day we might have forgiven you
your rapine and your murders; our towns that you have
sacked; your heavy yokes; your infamous treasons.  The
French race is so light of heart, so kindly, that we might
perhaps in time have forgotten our resentments.  What we
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P135"></a>135}</span>
never shall forget will be this New Year's Day, which we
have been forced to pass without news from our families.
You, at least, have had letters from your Gretchers, astounding
letters, very likely, in which the melancholy blondes
with blue eyes make a wonderful literary salad, composed
of sour kraut, berlin wool, forget-me-nots, pillage,
bombardment, pure love, and transcendental philosophy.  But you
like all this just as you like jam with your mutton.  You
have what pleases you.  Your ugly faces receive kisses by
the post.  But you kill our pigeons, you intercept our letters,
you shoot at our balloons with your absurd <i>fusils de rempart</i>,
and you burst out into a heavy German grin when you get
hold of one of our bags, which are carrying to those we love
our vows, our hopes, our remembrances, our regrets, our
hearts."  And so on.
</p>

Labouchere had not a high opinion of French journalism
during the investment.  "A French journalist," he says,
"even when he is not obliged to do so, generally invents his
facts, and then reasons upon them with wonderful ingenuity.
One would think that just at present a Parisian would do
well to keep his breath to cool his own porridge.  Such,
however, is not his opinion.  He thinks that he has a mission
to guide and instruct the world, and this mission he
manfully fulfils in defiance of Prussians and Prussian cannons.
It is true, that he knows rather less of foreign countries than
an intelligent Japanese Daimio may be supposed to know of
Tipperary, but, by some curious law of nature, the less he
knows of a subject, the more strongly does he feel impelled
to write about it.  I read a very clever article this morning
pointing out that if we are not on our guard, our Empire in
India will come to an end by a Russian fleet attacking it
from the Caspian Sea.  When one thinks how very easy it
would have been for the author not to have written about
the Caspian Sea, one is at once surprised and grateful to
him for having called our attention to the danger which
menaces us in that quarter of the globe."

His estimate of General Trochu was, on the whole, the
fairest that was made at the period.  During the earliest
days of the siege it was supposed that Trochu had a plan,
and, on being questioned about it, he admitted that he had.
He went on to say that he guaranteed its success, but that
he should reveal it to no one, until the right moment&mdash;in
fact, he had deposited it for safety with his notary, Maître
Duclos, who, in the event of his being killed, would produce
it.  As time wore on and no plan was forthcoming from the
General, it became very evident that it could have been
nothing more elaborate than a determination to capitulate
as soon as Paris was starved out.  When the siege was nearly
five weeks old Labouchere wrote:
</p>

<p>
"Every day this siege lasts, convinces me that Gen. Trochu
is not the right man in the right place.  He writes
long-winded letters, utters Spartan aphorisms, and complains
of his colleagues, his generals, and his troops.  The confidence
which is felt in him is rapidly diminishing.  He is a good,
respectable man, without a grain of genius, or of that fierce,
indomitable energy which sometimes replaces it.  He would
make a good minister of war in quiet times, but he is about
as fit to command in the present emergency as Mr. Cardwell[<a id="chap06fn10text"></a><a href="#chap06fn10">10</a>]
would be.  His two principal military subordinates, Vinoy
and Ducrot, are excellent Generals of division, but nothing
more.  As for his civilian colleagues they are one and all
hardly more practical than Professor Fawcett.  Each has
some crotchet of his own, each likes to dogmatise and to
speechify, and each considers the others to be idiots, and has
a small following of his own, which regards him as a species
of divinity.  They are philosophers, orators, and legists,
but they are neither practical men nor statesmen."  And
when the siege was over he summed up the case for Trochu
thus: "What will be the verdict of history on the defence?
Who knows!  On the one hand, the Parisians have kept a
powerful army at bay for longer than was expected; on the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P137"></a>137}</span>
other hand, every sortie that they have made has been
unsuccessful&mdash;every attempt to arrest the approach of the
besiegers has failed.  Passively and inertly they have
allowed their store of provisions to grow less and less, until
they have been forced to capitulate, without their defences
having been stormed, or the cannon silenced.  The General
complains of his soldiers, the soldiers complain of their
General; and on both sides there is cause of complaint.
Trochu is not a Todleben.  His best friends describe him
as a weak sort of military Hamlet, wise of speech, but weak
and hesitating in action&mdash;making plans and then criticising
them, instead of accomplishing them.  As a commander
his task was a difficult one; when the siege commenced he
had no army; when the army was formed it was encompassed
by earthworks and redoubts so strong that even
better soldiers would have failed to carry them.  As a
statesman, he never was master of the situation.  He followed
rather than led public opinion.  Success is the criterion
of ability in this country, and poor Trochu is as politically
dead as though he never had lived."
</p>

<p>
As time wore on the question of meals in the besieged
city naturally became one of absorbing moment.  "I went,"
says Labouchere, on December 21, "to see what was going
on in the house of a friend of mine, in the Avenue de
L'Impératrice, who has left Paris.  The servant who was in
charge told me that up there they had not been able to
obtain bread for three days, and that the last time he had
presented his ticket, he had been given about half an inch
of cheese.  'How do you live then?' I asked.  After looking
mysteriously round to see that no one was watching us,
he took me down into the cellar, and pointed to some meat
in a barrel.  'It is half a horse,' he said, in the tone of a man
who is showing some one the corpse of his murdered victim.
'A neighbouring coachman killed him, and we salted him
down, and divided him.'  Then he opened a closet in which
sat a huge cat.  'I am fattening her up for Christmas day;
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P138"></a>138}</span>
we mean to serve her up, surrounded with mice like sausages,'
he observed."  On January 6 Labouchere notes: "Yesterday
I had a slice of Pollux for dinner.  Pollux and his
brother Castor are two elephants, which have been killed.
It was tough, coarse, and oily, and I do not recommend
English families to eat elephant as long as they can get beef
or mutton.  Many of the restaurants are closed, owing to
want of fuel.  They are recommended to use lamps; but
although French cooks can do wonders with very poor
materials, when they are called upon to cook an elephant
with a spirit lamp the thing is almost beyond their ingenuity.
Castor and Pollux's trunks sold for forty-five francs a pound;
the other parts of the interesting twins fetched about ten
francs a pound."
</p>

<p>
He wrote to his mother on January 8[<a id="chap06fn11text"></a><a href="#chap06fn11">11</a>]: "Here we still
are.  For the last few days the Prussians have taken to
throwing shells into the town, which makes things more
lively.  I do not think it can last much longer.  It is awfully
cold, for all the wood is freshly cut and will not burn.  The
washerwomen have struck as they have no fuel, so we all
wear very dirty shirts.  I am in a great fright of my money
giving out, as none is to be got here.  My dress is seedy&mdash;in
fact falling to pieces.  I think I have eaten now of every
animal which Noah had in his ark.[<a id="chap06fn12text"></a><a href="#chap06fn12">12</a>]  Since the bombardment
the cannon makes a great noise.  All night it is as if
doors were slamming.  Outside the walls it is rather pretty
to see the batteries exchanging shots.  We have heard
nothing from England since September, except from scraps
of paper picked out of dead Prussians' pockets."  Labouchere
was always ready to recall to his memory for conversational
purposes the strange food he ate during the siege
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P139"></a>139}</span>
of Paris.  Donkey apparently was his favourite dish.  This
is what he said on the subject:
</p>

<p>
"A donkey is infinitely better eating than beef or mutton,
indeed I do not know any meat which is better.  This was
so soon discovered by the French, during the siege of Paris,
that donkey meat was about five times the price of horse
meat.  At Voisin's there was almost every day a joint of
cold donkey for breakfast, and it was greatly preferred to
anything else.  Let any one who doubts the excellence of
cold donkey slay one of these weak-minded animals, cook
him, and eat him."  Rats he did not appreciate so much:
"The objection to them is that when cooked their flesh is
gritty.  This objection is, however, somewhat Epicurean,
for, except for this grittiness, they are a wholesome and
excellent article of food.  I am surprised that there is not
a society for the promotion of eating rats.  Why should not
prisoners be fed with these nourishing and prolific little
animals?"
</p>

<p>
His account of how he got a leg of mutton into Paris
after the capitulation, when, in spite of the siege being raised,
the difficulties of procuring food were almost as insurmountable
as before, was one of his most amusing <i>contes</i>.  He
rode out to Versailles,[<a id="chap06fn13text"></a><a href="#chap06fn13">13</a>] where he procured the longed-for
joint, but, when he started on his return journey, a
sentinel of Versailles refused to allow the meat to leave the
town, and actually took it away from him.  Desperately
he decided to appeal to the better side of the Prussian's
nature, and explained to him that he was in love, indeed,
that to love was the fate of all mortals.  The warrior sighed
and pensively assented: Labouchere judged that he was
most likely thinking of his distant Gretchen, and shamelessly
followed up his advantage: "My lady love is in Paris,"
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P140"></a>140}</span>
he proceeded pathetically, "long have I sighed in vain.  I
am taking her now a leg of mutton&mdash;on this leg hangs all
my hope of bliss&mdash;if I present myself to her with this token
of my devotion she may yield to my suit.  Oh, full of feeling,
beloved of beauteous women, German warrior, can you
refuse me?"  Of course the sentinel yielded, and the
correspondent, who, needless to say, had no lady love in the
capital, bore it off in triumph.  He enjoyed it for dinner
that evening in company with Mr. Frank Lawley and Mr. Denis
Bingham, in whose journal for that day occurs the
following entry:
</p>

<p>
"On their return from Versailles together, Labouchere
and Lawley brought me a leg of mutton.  And what a
treat it was for our small household and dear neighbours!
And an Italian lady brought us a large loaf of white bread,
and we feasted and were merry, and measured our girths,
and promised ourselves that we would soon get into
condition again, for we were lamentably pulled down."[<a id="chap06fn14text"></a><a href="#chap06fn14">14</a>]
</p>

<p>
On February 10, Labouchere took his departure from
Paris, feeling, as he said, much as Daniel must have done
on emerging from the den of lions.  Baron Rothschild
procured for him a pass which enabled him to take the Amiens
train at the goods station within the walls of the city, instead
of driving, as those who were less fortunate were obliged to
do, to Gonesse.  The train was drawn up before a shed in
the midst of oceans of mud.  It consisted of one passenger
carriage, and of a long series of empty bullock vans.  He
entered one of the latter as the passenger van was already
crowded.  At Breteuil the train waited for above an hour,
and Labouchere, impatient of the delay, perceiving a Prussian
train puffing up, managed to induce an official to allow
him to get into the luggage van, by which means he was able
to proceed on his way to the destination.  "Having started
from Paris as a bullock, I reached Amiens at twelve o'clock
as a carpet-bag," was the way he described his journey.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P141"></a>141}</span>
</p>

<p>
At Abbeville the train passed out of the Prussian lines
into the French, and Calais was reached at 7 P.M.  "Right
glad" was the Paris correspondent, to use his own words,
to "eat a Calais supper and to sleep on a Calais bed."[<a id="chap06fn15text"></a><a href="#chap06fn15">15</a>]
</p>

<p>
In his last letter to the <i>Daily News</i> during the war,
Mr. Labouchere lodged one other Parthian shot in the city
whose hospitality he had been enjoying: "I took my
departure from Paris," he wrote, "leaving without any very
poignant regret, its inhabitants wending their way to the
electoral 'urns,' the many revolving in their minds how
France and Paris are to manage to pay the little bill which
their creditor outside is making up against them; the few&mdash;the
very few&mdash;determined to die rather than yield, sitting
in the cafés on the boulevard, which is to be, I presume,
their last ditch."
</p>

<p>
In one of his earliest numbers of <i>Truth</i>, Mr. Labouchere
gave a characteristic account of how he behaved under fire.
It is worth quoting as illustrative of the naïve frankness with
which he always described those instinctive little actions of
human nature which more sophisticated persons usually
pretend never occur.  "I was at some of the engagements
during the Franco-Prussian War.  The first time that I
was under fire, I felt that every shell whizzing through the
air would infallibly blow me up.  Being a non-combatant,
in an unconcerned sort of way, as if I had business to attend
to elsewhere, I effected a strategical movement to the rear.
But, as no shell had blown me up, I came to the conclusion
that no shell would blow me up, and accepted afterwards
as a natural state of things which did not concern me, the
fact that these missiles occasionally blew up other people."

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br><br>
LABOUCHERE AND BRADLAUGH
</h3>

<p class="t3">
(1880-1881)
</p>

<p>
At the general election of 1880, Mr. Labouchere found in
the electors of Northampton a constituency which was
to remain faithful to him throughout his political career.
He was described in the local press as the "nominee of the
moderate Liberals," though, as he explained in the columns
of <i>Truth</i>, a moderate Liberal at Northampton was a Radical
any where else.  The "Radical" candidate was that upright
and greatly persecuted man, Mr. Charles Bradlaugh, who
merited far more than Mr. Labouchere the title of the
"religious member for Northampton."[<a id="chap07fn1text"></a><a href="#chap07fn1">1</a>]  It has often been pointed
out that the difference between religious and irreligious
people does not lie so much in opinion as in temperament.
Labouchere had an essentially irreligious nature, he was a
born <i>impie</i>, as the French say: Mr. Bradlaugh had the soul
of a Covenanter.  As far as speculative religious opinions
were concerned, they practically coincided, while, in the
general lines of political opinion, they were quite at one.
Both were strong Radicals and strong anti-socialists.
</p>

<p>
Northampton was in 1880 one of the most promising
Radical constituencies.[<a id="chap07fn2text"></a><a href="#chap07fn2">2</a>]  The Radical element had for
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P143"></a>143}</span>
many years been very numerous among the population,
but unfortunately the majority of the workers had no vote.
The Household Suffrage Act of 1868 remedied this state of
things to some extent.  The work of the Freehold Land
Society developed the scope of the remedy.  This most
practical expression of democratic ideals, by making
freeholders of workmen, raised the numbers of the electorate
from 6829 in 1874 to 8189 in 1880; of these 2500 had never
voted before, and to a man were Radicals.  When Mr. Labouchere
was introduced as Liberal candidate he at once decided
to make common cause with Mr. Bradlaugh, and his manifesto
to the electors, published on March 27, was craftily
worded so as to appeal with simple directness to those
modern sons of St. Crispin, "the communistic cobblers of
Northampton."  It ran as follows: "Having already sat
in Parliament as a Liberal member for Middlesex, it is
needless for me to say that I am an opponent of the Imperialism
which, under the leadership of the Earl of Beaconsfield,
has become the policy of the Conservative Government.
This new-fangled political creed consists in swagger abroad
and inaction at home.  Its results are that we have made
ourselves the patrons of one of the vilest governments that
ever burdened the earth; that we have joined with the
oppressors against the oppressed; that we have acquired a
pestiferous and less than worthless land in the Mediterranean;
that we have annexed the territory of some harmless
Dutch republicans against their will; that we have expended
above six millions in catching a savage, who had as much
right to his freedom as we have, and that we have butchered
Afghans for the crime of defending their country against
an unjust invasion....  For my part, I am anxious to see
Parliament again controlling the executive, and a majority
of members returned who will radically revise the laws
regarding land, so as to encourage its tenure by the many
instead of its absorption by the few, who will render farmers
independent of the caprices of the landlords, who will emancipate
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P144"></a>144}</span>
the agricultural labourers by securing to them their
natural right to vote."  He went on to express in strong
terms his desire for the disestablishment and disendowment
of the Church of England.[<a id="chap07fn3text"></a><a href="#chap07fn3">3</a>]  In a speech which he made on
the same day as the publication of his manifesto, in the
Wesleyan Chapel, in the Wellingborough Road, he said that
he had been asked a little while ago whether he was a member
of the Church of England, and he had replied that he had
been brought up in the Church of England, and, if he had
to register his religion, he should register it as a member of
the Church of England.  But, if he had been asked what his
religion was, he should have said the question was one
between his God and his conscience, and it was no business of
any one's in Northampton, because he stood upon the distinct
issue that, whatever the religious opinions of a candidate
might be, they were sending him to Parliament to perform
certain political duties, and if his political views were in
accordance with theirs, religion had nothing to do with it.[<a id="chap07fn4text"></a><a href="#chap07fn4">4</a>]
</p>

<p>
The borough had previously returned two Tory members,
Mr. Phipps, a local brewer, and Mr. Merewether, a lawyer.
They were not themselves very formidable opponents to the
Radical joint candidature.  The clergy and the press urged
the theological motive, as well as his greatly misunderstood
views on Malthusianism against Bradlaugh.  On the Sunday
before the election the Vicar of St. Giles intimated that "to
those noble men who loved Christ more than party, Jesus
would say, 'Well done.'"  But, in spite of nearly 2000 years
of Christianity, heaven has not yet learned to bless the
weaker cause, and on the election day, the figures
stood&mdash;Labouchere (L.), 4518, Bradlaugh (R.), 3827, Phipps (C.),
3125, Merewether (C.), 2826.  When the news of the poll was
brought to Mr. Labouchere, who was smoking his cigarette
in the coffee room of the hotel where he was staying, his only
comment was a quiet chuckle, and the remark, "Oh, they've
swallowed Bradlaugh, after all, have they?"
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P145"></a>145}</span>
</p>

<p>
Great was the fury in the Conservative camp.  "The
bellowing blasphemer of Northampton," as Mr. Bradlaugh
was amiably called by the <i>Sheffield Telegraph</i>, had to meet
the full blast of popular prejudice, which was exploited to
the utmost by his political opponents.
</p>

<p>
The Tories were soon to have more than popular prejudice
to exploit.  On May 3, Mr. Bradlaugh, before taking
his seat in the House of Commons, handed to Sir Thomas
Erskine May, the Clerk of the House, the following
statement:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
<i>To</i>
</p>

<p class="quote">
THE RIGHT HONBLE. THE SPEAKER.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I, the undersigned, Charles Bradlaugh, beg respectfully to
claim to be allowed to affirm as a person for the time being by law
permitted to make a solemn affirmation or declaration, instead
of taking an oath.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
On being invited by the Speaker (Sir Henry Brand) to
make a statement to the House with regard to his claim, he
replied:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
Mr. Speaker, I have only now to submit that the Parliamentary
Oaths Act, 1866, gives the right to affirm to every person for
the time being permitted to make affirmation.  I am such a
person; and under the Evidence Amendment Act, 1869, and the
Evidence Amendment Act, 1870, I have repeatedly for nine
years past affirmed in the highest courts of jurisdiction in this
realm.  I am ready to make the declaration or affirmation of
allegiance.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
It might have been thought that the principle of Mr. Bradlaugh's
position needed only to be stated to be accepted
by men of honourable feeling and average intelligence.
After all, as Mr. Labouchere, in course of conversation on
this very point, once remarked to me: "a statement is either
true or false, and expletives cannot affect it."  The legal
precedents, invoked, although they did not actually mention
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P146"></a>146}</span>
the parliamentary oath, had been considered sufficient by
the last Liberal law officers.  Sir Henry Brand, however,
had "grave doubts," and desired to refer the claim to the
House's judgment.  Lord Frederick Cavendish, on behalf
of the Treasury Bench, seconded by Sir Stafford Northcote,
the leader of the Opposition, moved that the point be
referred to a Select Committee.  Lord Percy and Mr. David
Onslow attempted in vain to adjourn the debate.
</p>

<p>
On May 10, Lord Richard Grosvenor, the Government
Whip, announced the names of the proposed Committee:
Mr. Whitbread, Sir J. Holker, Mr. John Bright, Lord Henry
Lennox, Mr. W. H. Massey, Mr. Staveley Hill, Sir Henry
Jackson, Sir Henry James (the Attorney-General),
Mr. Farrer Herschell (the Solicitor-General), Sir G. Goldney,
Mr. Grantham, Mr. Pemberton, Mr. Watkin Williams,
Mr. Spencer Walpole, Mr. Hopwood, Mr. Beresford Hope, Major
Nolan, Mr. Chaplin, and Mr. Serjeant Simon.  In spite of
the fact that the actual motion was not to come on till the
next day, Sir Henry Drummond Wolff endeavoured at once
to raise a debate on the legitimacy of the Committee, and
the next day succeeded in doing so.  The debate was
characterised by "great violence and recklessness," but the
Government succeeded in getting their Committee appointed
by a majority of seventy-four.  The report of the
Committee was presented on May 20.  Eight members were
in favour of Mr. Bradlaugh's right to affirm, and eight
members against: Mr. Spencer Walpole, the Chairman,
took the responsibility of giving his casting vote for the
Noes.  All the Noes with the exception of Mr. Hopwood
were Conservatives, the rest of the Liberals voting on the
affirmative side.  Bradlaugh now claimed the right to take
the oath, as the right to affirm was denied him.
</p>

<p>
There has been so much misunderstanding of Bradlaugh's
position on this point that it may be well to explain exactly
what it was that he did claim.  In a statement of his case
subsequently published in his paper, <i>The National Reformer</i>,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P147"></a>147}</span>
on May 30, 1889, Mr. Bradlaugh used the following words:
"My duty to my constituents is to fulfil the mandate they
have given me, and if, to do this, I have to submit to a form
less solemn to me than the affirmation I would have
reverently made, so much the worse for those who force me to
repeat words which I have scores of times declared are to
me sounds conveying no clear and definite meaning.  I am
sorry for the earnest believers who see words sacred to them
used as a meaningless addendum to a promise, but I cannot
permit their less sincere co-religionists to use an idle form,
in order to prevent me from doing my duty to those who
have chosen me to speak for them in Parliament.  <i>I shall,
taking the oath, regard myself, as bound, not by the letter of its
words, but by the spirit which the affirmation would have
conveyed had I been permitted to use it</i>.  So soon as I am able,
I shall take such steps as may be consistent with parliamentary
business to put an end to the present doubtful and
unfortunate state of the law and practice on oaths and
affirmations."
</p>

<p>
The words italicised indicate very clearly the spirit in
which Mr. Bradlaugh proposed to take the oath.  To do so,
was, as he conceived, the only way, since the adverse decision
of the Committee on his claim to affirm, by which he could
qualify himself for the performance of his duty to his
constituents.  It was in no sense intended as an insult to those
to whom the oath had a distinct and positive religious value,
or as a defiance of the dignity or orders of the House.  This
document was dated May 30, the day on which the report
of the Committee was issued, and on the following day,
Mr. Bradlaugh presented himself to take the oath and his
seat.
</p>

<p>
Sir Henry Drummond Wolff at once rose and objected
to the administration of the oath, and, on the Speaker's
allowing his objection, proceeded to make a remarkable
speech.  For flippancy of tone and sheer ineptitude of
argument, not to speak of the crass and brutal quality of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P148"></a>148}</span>
the prejudice which inspired it, this deliverance possesses
an unenviable pre-eminence among the many absurdities
uttered by honourable members during the Bradlaugh
parliamentary struggle.  Wolff's argument rested on two
grounds, both palpably false, while the second was entirely
irrelevant to the point at issue.  He maintained that
Atheists who had made affirmations in courts of law (as
Mr. Bradlaugh had done) thereby admitted that an oath "would
not be binding on their conscience," and, furthermore, that
Bradlaugh had stated, in his "Impeachment of the House
of Brunswick," that "Parliament has the undoubted right
to withhold the crown from Albert Edward, Prince of Wales."  Sir
Henry "could not see how a gentleman professing the
views set forth in that work could take the oath of
allegiance."  He went on to say: "What we have now before us
is the distinct negation of anything like perpetual morality
or conscience, or the existence of God.  And, as I believe that
a person holding these views cannot be allowed to take the
oath in this House, I beg to move my resolution."  Mr. R. N. Forster
seconded.  Mr. Gladstone at once rose and, while
refraining from expressing any personal opinion, suggested
reference to a Select Committee.  Sir Henry James supported
the Prime Minister's amendment.  Mr. Labouchere, speaking
as the colleague of the honourable member in the
representation of Northampton, said that he thought it right
to state that his honourable friend was selected by the
majority of the constituents solely on account of his political
views.  They did not occupy themselves with his religious
convictions, because they were under the impression that
they were giving him political, rather than theological,
functions to fulfil in that House.  A proposal had been made
by the Prime Minister that this matter should be referred
to a Select Committee.  It certainly did appear to him
(Mr. Labouchere) somewhat strange that a member who
had been duly elected should be told that he could not take
his seat because he was forbidden to make an affirmation on
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P149"></a>149}</span>
account of his not being a Quaker or a Moravian, and
because he was forbidden from taking the oath on account of
certain speculative religious opinions, which he had
professed.  But that appeared to be the view of many gentlemen
on the other side of the House, and he should be perfectly
ready to discuss that view; but, as the Prime Minister had
very rightly said, the matter was a judicial one, and it would be
far better, in his humble opinion, that it should be referred
to a Committee of the House to look at it in its judicial aspect
rather than that there should be an acrimonious theological
discussion in that House.  When, however, it was referred
to a Committee, he thought that he had a right to ask,
in the name of his constituents, that that Committee should
decide it as soon as possible.  Should the Committee decide
that the honourable gentleman was not to be allowed to take
the oath, it would then become, if not his duty, the duty of
some other honourable gentleman to bring in a bill to enable
his colleague to make an affirmation in order that his
constituents might enjoy the right which the constitution gave
them of being represented by two members in that House.
</p>

<p>
Lord Percy drily observed that he was sorry for the
electors of Northampton if they were deprived of the services
of one of their representatives, because the honourable
gentleman was recommended to them by his honourable
colleague, whose religious opinions were well known, and,
after an eloquent speech from Mr. Bright, who recommended
"the statesmanlike and judicious course which has been
suggested to us by the First Minister of the Crown," the
debate was adjourned.
</p>

<p>
On the resumption of the debate the next day, the wildest
remarks were made by Mr. Bradlaugh's opponents.  Dr. Lyons
proposed the solution that "Northampton should
send us a God-fearing if not a God-loving man."  Mr. Warton
argued that "the man who does not fear God cannot
honour the King," and Mr. Callan scoffed at Mr. Bright's
tribute of respect to Mr. Bradlaugh's sense of honour and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P150"></a>150}</span>
conscience, "language," he said, "that should not be used
with reference to an infidel blasphemer."  After the din
caused by this <i>ex parte</i> criticism had subsided, the still small
voice of Mr. Labouchere was heard mildly asking whether
the honourable member was in order in referring to his
colleague as an infidel blasphemer, and the Speaker having
ruled the phrase out of order, Mr. Callan withdrew it.  He
was, however, an ardent polemist, and added that he was
sure that Mr. Labouchere, in spite of his support of
Mr. Bradlaugh, "would prefer in this House his old acquaintance
Lambri Pasha to the gentleman who was the subject of the
debate."  And so the foolish wrangle went on, recalling
the historian's account of the Œcumenical Council.  It is
true that the amateur theologians of Westminster stopped
short of pulling each other's beards.  Their zeal had not
quite the professional note of that of the Fathers at Ephesus.
</p>

<p>
After two days of this sort of thing, Sir Henry Drummond
Wolff's motion was rejected by 289 votes to 219, and a second
Select Committee of twenty-three was appointed.  The
members were: the Attorney-General, the Solicitor-General,
Messrs. Bright, Chaplin, Childers, Sir Richard Cross,
Mr. Gibson, Sir Gabriel Goldney, Mr. Grantham, Mr. Staveley
Hill, Sir John Holker, Mr. Beresford Hope, Mr. Hopwood,
Sir Henry Jackson, Lord Henry Lennox, Mr. Massey, Major
Nolan, Messrs. Pemberton, Simon, Trevelyan, Walpole,
Whitbread, and Watkin Williams.
</p>

<p>
The Committee reported that Bradlaugh by simply
stating (though in answer to official question) that he had
repeatedly affirmed under certain Acts in courts of law, had
brought it to the notice of the House that he was a person
as to whom judges had satisfied themselves that an oath was
not binding on his conscience; that, under the circumstances,
an oath taken by him would not be an oath within the true
meaning of the statutes; and that the House therefore could,
and ought, to prevent him from going through the form.
The Committee further suggested that he should be allowed
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P151"></a>151}</span>
to affirm with a view to his right to do so being tested by
legal action, pointing to the nearly equal balance of votes
in the former Committee as a reason for desiring a decisive
legal solution.
</p>

<p>
On June 21, Mr. Labouchere moved "that Mr. Bradlaugh,
member for the borough of Northampton, be admitted
to make an affirmation or declaration instead of the
oath required by law."  This speech was one of the best he
ever made in the House.  It was an admirable piece of
argument and an excellent piece of literature, solidly reasoned
and witty; "it is contrary to, it is repugnant to, the feelings
of all men of tolerant minds that any gentleman should be
hindered from performing civil functions in this world on
account of speculative opinions about another"&mdash;was a
terse summing up of the situation worthy of Gibbon.  His
main argument was that the Parliamentary Oaths Act of
1866 gave to all persons, legally entitled to affirm in the law
courts, the right to affirm in Parliament.  He further pointed
out that the refusal to allow Bradlaugh to affirm would be
to turn him into a martyr.  Mr. Bright again made a fine
speech in which he said, amid ironical cheers from the
Opposition, that he pretended to no conscience and honour
superior to the conscience of Mr. Bradlaugh.  Mr. Gladstone
also spoke cogently in favour of Mr. Labouchere's motion.
It was, however, lost by a majority of 45, of whom 5 were
English Liberals and 31 Irish Home Rulers.
</p>

<p>
On June 23, Mr. Bradlaugh again presented himself
at the table of the House.  The Speaker called on him to
withdraw, in accordance with the vote of the night before.
Mr. Labouchere then moved that "Mr. Bradlaugh be now
heard at the Bar of the House," following which motion
Mr. Bradlaugh made an eloquent and dignified defence of his
position.  A confused debate followed, and Mr. Labouchere
moved that "Yesterday's decision be rescinded," withdrawing
his motion, however, on an appeal from Mr. Gladstone.
The Speaker then recalled Bradlaugh to the table,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P152"></a>152}</span>
and informed him that the House had nothing to say to him
beyond once more calling upon him to withdraw.  Bradlaugh
replied: "I beg respectfully to insist on my right as a duly
elected member for Northampton.  I ask you to have the
oath administered to me in order that I may take my seat,
and I respectfully refuse to withdraw."  After a second
admonition from the Speaker, to which Bradlaugh replied,
"With respect I do refuse to obey the orders of the House,
which are against the law," the House was appealed to "to
give authority to the Chair to compel execution of its
orders."  Mr. Gladstone, although called upon, did not rise.  He
appeared to be absorbed in deep thought, and, with his
gaze fixed on a vague distance, just above the heads of the
belligerent theologians, he meditatively twirled his thumbs.
Northcote hesitatingly moved, "though I am not quite sure
what the terms of the motion should be, that Mr. Speaker
do take the necessary steps for requiring and enforcing the
withdrawal of the honourable member for Northampton."  The
Speaker explained that the motion should simply be
"that the honourable member do now withdraw."  On a
division being taken, 326 voted in favour of the motion
and only 38 against.  On the Speaker renewing his order,
Mr. Bradlaugh answered: "With submission to you, Sir,
the order of the House is against the law, and I respectfully
refuse to obey it."  The Sergeant-at-Arms was now called,
and touching him on the shoulder, requested him to withdraw.
Mr. Bradlaugh said: "I will submit to the Sergeant-at-Arms
removing me below the Bar, but I shall immediately
return to the table," and did so, saying as he returned toward
the table, "I claim my right as a member of this House."  This
little ceremony was repeated twice, the House being in
an uproar.  High above the din, Mr. Bradlaugh's voice
could be heard shouting: "I claim my right as a member of
this House.  I admit the right of the House to imprison
me, but I admit no right on the part of the House to exclude
me, and I refuse to be excluded."  He was again led to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P153"></a>153}</span>
the Bar by the Sergeant-at-Arms to await the House's
action.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bradlaugh had, no doubt not unintentionally, indicated
to his enemies the only line they could take.  It was
his tactic, and a wise one, to force the House into the extreme
measure of physical force.  To do so was a fair retort from
a Rationalist to his opponents.  Northcote, complaining
again of Mr. Gladstone's inaction, proceeded to move that
"Mr. Bradlaugh, having defied the authority of the House,
be taken into the custody of the Sergeant-at-Arms."  Mr. Labouchere
at once rose and said that he would not oppose
the resolution, although he thought it a somewhat strange
thing that a citizen of this country should be sent to prison
for doing what eminent legal gentlemen on his side and an
eminent legal gentleman on the other side of the House said
he had a perfect right to do.  He was interrupted by cries
of "No, No!"  He continued that he did not know whether
honourable members opposite meant to say that the honourable
and learned gentleman, the late Attorney-General, was
not an eminent legal authority on such a point.  That was
the view taken by that honourable and learned gentleman.
It seemed a somewhat hard thing that any one should be put
into prison for doing what a general consensus of legal
opinion in that House held to be his duty and his right.  But,
as the Prime Minister had stated, it was useless to oppose
the motion, because Mr. Bradlaugh had come into conflict
with a resolution of the House, whether that resolution were
right or wrong.  He, regretting as he did the necessity that
had been forced upon the House, did not think he should
be serving any good purpose in opposing the resolution, or
in asking the House to go into a vote on this question.  He
believed himself that the sending of Mr. Bradlaugh into
custody would be the first step towards his becoming a
recognised member of the House.  It is interesting to note
that Mr. Parnell also spoke in favour of Mr. Bradlaugh, and
said that, if Irish members voted for his imprisonment,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P154"></a>154}</span>
they would be going contrary to the feeling of their country.
On a division being taken there were 274 Ayes to 7 Noes,
and Mr. Bradlaugh was removed in the custody of the
Sergeant-at-Arms to the Clock Tower.
</p>

<p>
The imprisonment was rather an insult than an injury.
The prisoner received his friends freely and openly, and
proceeded to the business of fighting his battle in the country
from his "cell."  A cry of indignation, which must have
greatly surprised the Tories, went up all over England, and,
on the next day, Northcote, at the urgent advice, it is said,
of Lord Beaconsfield, moved for Bradlaugh's immediate
and unconditional release.  On Sir Stafford making his
motion, Mr. Labouchere pointed out to the House, "in order
that there may be no misconception in the matter," that
Mr. Bradlaugh would immediately on his release "return
to the House and do what the Prime Minister, the colleagues
of the Prime Minister, the present Attorney-General and
the late Attorney-General, say he has an absolute legal right
to do."  The motion was nevertheless agreed to, and
Mr. Bradlaugh was released.
</p>

<p>
The next day, June 25, Mr. Labouchere gave notice
that he should move on the following Tuesday that the
resolution of the House, which had resulted in Mr. Bradlaugh's
imprisonment, should be read and rescinded.  He
also asked for special facilities from the Government on
that day for bringing the matter before the House.
Mr. Gladstone, whilst reserving his answer as to the particular
form of proceeding, agreed that "it was certainly requisite
and necessary that the subject of Mr. Bradlaugh's right
should be considered," and promised facilities for the day
mentioned by Mr. Labouchere.  On the Monday, however,
Mr. Gladstone himself informed the House that the Government
had framed the following resolution, which they
intended to submit: "That every person returned as a member
of this House, who may claim to be a person for the time
being by law permitted to make a solemn affirmation or
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P155"></a>155}</span>
declaration instead of taking an oath, shall, henceforth
(notwithstanding so much of the resolution adopted by this
House on the 22d of June last, as relates to affirmation),
be permitted without question to make and subscribe a
solemn affirmation in the form prescribed by the Parliamentary
Oaths Act, 1866, as altered by the Promissory Oaths
Act, 1868, subject to any liability by Statute; and, secondly,
that this resolution be a standing Order of this House."  The
Prime Minister then expressed the hope that, as the
question would be raised in what the Government considered
the most convenient manner, Mr. Labouchere would not
consider it necessary to proceed with any motion on the
following day.  Mr. Labouchere withdrew his resolution
"after the very satisfactory Notice, which has just been
given by the Prime Minister."
</p>

<p>
The next day, when Mr. Gladstone made his motion,
Sir John Gorst opposed it, on the technical ground that it
was a breach of the Rule of the House, which laid down that,
if a question had been considered by the House and a definite
judgment pronounced, the same, or what was substantially
the same, question could not be put again to the House
during the same session.  This contention was, however,
overruled by the Speaker, and, on a division being taken, the
Prime Minister's resolution was accepted by a majority
of 54, the Ayes numbering 303 and the Noes 249.  Bradlaugh
was now free to affirm at his own legal risk, and he
did so the next day, thus bringing to a conclusion the first
movement of this ironic symphony.
</p>

<p>
There can be no doubt that Mr. Labouchere's great
speech of June 21 contributed powerfully to this result.
Apart from the speeches of Mr. Gladstone and Mr. Bright,
and indeed Mr. Bradlaugh's own fine speech at the Bar of
the House on June 23, it was the only attempt made to
present the constitutional and legal aspects of Bradlaugh's
case in their true light.  The subject was one that appealed
very strongly to Mr. Labouchere.  In personal agreement
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P156"></a>156}</span>
with the views which it was sought to penalise in the person
of Mr. Bradlaugh (although it would have been alien to his
temperament to have enrolled himself as a partisan of those
views), his attack on Mr. Bradlaugh's enemies acquired
weight and energy from the love of individual liberty that
was at the bottom of his character, and his detestation, on
that, as on every other occasion of his public life, of
oppression and prejudice.
</p>

<p>
The prejudice aroused by Bradlaugh's entrance into the
House of Commons was slow to disperse.  Numerous petitions
for his exclusion from Parliament were signed, in some
cases, <i>en bloc</i>, by Sunday-school children.  The varieties
of English Protestantism were all zealous in the good cause,
and Cardinal Manning, who wrote a violent article in the
<i>Nineteenth Century</i> on the subject, succeeded in presenting
a monster petition from English and exiled Irish Roman
Catholics.  There were, however, some notable exceptions
among those who represented the religious principle.  Several
clergymen of the Church of England and not a few
Non-conformist ministers wrote to the papers on his behalf.
Newman refused to sign the petition, on constitutional
grounds, and the "Home Government Association of
Glasgow" sent to Bradlaugh a resolution stating "that this
meeting of Irish Roman Catholics ... most emphatically
condemns the spirit of domination and intolerance arrayed
against you, and views with astonishment and indignation
the cowardly acquiescence and, in a few instances, active
support, on the part of a large majority of the Irish Home
Rule members to the policy of oppression exercised against
you."  Such voices were, however, few and far between;
in the House itself the Opposition could not resist the
temptation of such a weapon against the Government.  It was good
policy, as Lord Henry Lennox said, in a moment of expansion,
"to put that damned Bradlaugh on them."  Mr. Labouchere
held an unswerving course in support of his
colleague.  Temperamentally, as has been said, he did not
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P157"></a>157}</span>
sympathise with Mr. Bradlaugh's attitude.  He did not
share Mr. Bradlaugh's view of the importance of transcendental
opinions of any shade, and his wider experience of
life and human nature led him to gauge more truly perhaps,
certainly very differently, the value in the social scheme of
other people's religious belief.  He would never himself
have raised the question raised by Mr. Bradlaugh, but he
was wise enough to realise that, once it was raised, there
was only one way of settling it.  In the course of his long
life, he championed many a victim of oppression and prejudice,
but it may be doubted whether his championship ever
showed to greater advantage, was ever more firmly based
on those wide views of justice which underlie genuine
political sagacity, and distinguish the true statesman from the
mere politician, than in the case of Mr. Bradlaugh's
parliamentary struggle.
</p>

<p>
The venue of that struggle was shortly transferred to
the law courts.  Bradlaugh had affirmed and taken his
seat at his own legal risk.  During the five months in which
Parliament sat between July, 1880, and March, 1881, he was
one of the most assiduous and energetic members of the
House.  On March 7, the action of one Clarke <i>v.</i> Bradlaugh
came on the Court of Queen's Bench before Mr. Justice
Matthew.  On the 11th the judge delivered his
judgment, which was against the defendant.  He said that
the Parliamentary Oaths Act, cited in his favour by
Bradlaugh, only permitted affirmation to persons holding
religious beliefs.  On judgment being delivered against him,
Bradlaugh applied for a stay of execution of costs, with
view to an appeal, which was granted, the judge consenting
to stay his verdict for the opinion of the Court of Appeal to
be taken.  The appeal was heard on March 30 by Lord
Justices Bramwell, Lush, and Baggallay, but their decision
was again adverse to the defendant.  The point taken was
not, as Mr. Labouchere had argued before the House, the
actual grammatical meaning of the wording of the Act, but
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P158"></a>158}</span>
the intention of the framers of the Act.  Their Lordships
held that it had only been intended to emancipate persons
possessed of positive religious beliefs rendering the taking
of an oath repugnant to their consciences.  This rendered
the second seat for Northampton vacant.  On April 1
Mr. Labouchere, in the course of moving for a new writ for the
borough of Northampton, said that a decision had now
been given against Bradlaugh by three judges, and, in all
probability, the House of Lords would decide against him.
He was authorised by Mr. Bradlaugh to say that he fully
accepted the law as laid down by the Court of Appeal, and
that it was not fair that Northampton should have one
member only&mdash;the election might be got over by the Easter
holidays, and honourable and right honourable gentlemen
would have an opportunity of considering what course they
would take should Mr. Bradlaugh be re-elected.  The writ
was issued, and Mr. Bradlaugh was, as Mr. Labouchere
had predicted, re-elected on April 9.  Mr. Labouchere
made a speech at Northampton, before the election, in
defence of his colleague, the interest of which was wider
than that of the Bradlaugh controversy on account of one
statement in it.  He described his leave-taking of
Mr. Gladstone, on his departure from London, in these words:
"And, men of Northampton, that grand old man said to me,
as he patted me on the shoulder, 'Henry my boy, bring him
back, bring him back!'"  I think Mr. Labouchere's autobiographical
Muse used a poetic license here.  It is certainly
difficult to imagine Mr. Gladstone patting the member for
Northampton on the back, and calling him "Henry, my
boy."  The success of this allusion to the Prime Minister,
however, was enormous, and the name stuck.  Mr. Gladstone
was the "Grand Old Man" for the rest of his life.
</p>

<p>
As every one knows, Bradlaugh again was not allowed to
take his seat.  That his attitude caused embarrassment to
the Liberal party cannot be denied.  At the end of June, he
wrote to Mr. Labouchere on the subject of forcing another
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P159"></a>159}</span>
contest in the House, and Mr. Labouchere forwarded his
letter to Mr. Chamberlain with the following comments:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
10 QUEEN ANNE'S GATE, July 2, 1881.
</p>

<p class="quote">
DEAR CHAMBERLAIN,&mdash;Please look at enclosed letter.  If
you think it of any use, show it to Mr. Gladstone.  I send it to
you in order that you may see what are, I take it, the genuine
intentions of Bradlaugh.  I had written to him to suggest that
he should go up to the table and take the oath at the end of the
Session, and I offered if he liked to do so on the last day of the
Session to talk on until the Black Rod appeared, or, if he preferred
to do so before, I said that Government always had a majority
during the last week or two, and that, probably, if a division
were taken upon expulsion, he would win it.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Yesterday I received a letter from the Executive Committee
of the Liberal and Radical Caucus at Northampton, telling me
that Bradlaugh had sent to call a public meeting next Wednesday,
and asking me to come down to meet the Committee on that day
to advise with them what to do, as Bradlaugh has asked for a
resolution to be passed, in the nature of a mandate ordering him
to take his seat.  I have written urging delay, but, of course, in
this matter I have to carry out the wishes of the constituency,
as the question regards them.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Whilst Bradlaugh exaggerates his strength, his opponents
underestimate it.  He can bring together a mob, with a vast
number of fanatics in it, ready for anything, and he contends that
he is illegally hindered from taking his seat, and therefore may
oppose physical force to physical force.
</p>

<p class="quote">
From what I gather, from many Members of Parliament,
they are very anxious that the matter should be settled this
Session, because they think that its being kept open will do the
Party great harm.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Why cannot the Bill[<a id="chap07fn5text"></a><a href="#chap07fn5">5</a>] be brought in after the Land Bill?  It
has but one clause, and if our side speak very briefly, the
Conservatives cannot go on talking for ever on so simple a matter.
Moreover, there are a good many Conservatives who have told
me that they are not against the Bill.&mdash;Yours truly,
</p>

<p class="quote">
H. LABOUCHERE.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P160"></a>160}</span>
</p>

<p>
Mr. Gladstone discouraged Bradlaugh from resorting
to any more militant methods just then, and intimated that
it would be useless to bring in the Oaths Bill, as they
proposed to close the session early in August, and they could
not hope to carry any strongly controversial measure after
the Land Bill.
</p>

<p>
This book is not a life of Bradlaugh, and it is enough to
have noted here the first phase of the ignoble struggle.  As
is well known, Bradlaugh returned to the House, and
following Mr. Labouchere's suggestion, administered the oath
to himself.  A sordid fight ensued on the attempt to remove
him forcibly, in which no merely formal violence was offered.
His clothes were torn off his back and, although a man of
unusual physical strength, he fainted in the <i>mêlée</i>.
Bradlaugh, in that Parliament, was never allowed to discharge
his duty as a member.  Once more re-elected by the
constituency in the General Election of 1885, the Speaker
would suffer no intervention, and he took the oath and his
seat, and in 1888, in spite of a Conservative majority, secured
the passing of an Affirmation Bill.  Finally, in 1891, when
Mr. Bradlaugh was lying on his death-bed, after a brief
parliamentary career that had won for him the respect of
all parties, the resolution of January 22, 1881, that had been
passed amid "such ecstatic transports," was expunged from
the records of the House.  I cannot refrain from quoting
the fine tribute paid to his memory and excellent summing
up of the case as bearing on the real crux of the situation,
made by Mr. Gladstone, a few days later, in the course
of introducing his Religious Disabilities Removal Bill on
February 4:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
A distinguished man and an admirable member of this House
was laid yesterday in his mother earth.  He was the subject of
a long controversy in this House, the beginning of which we
recollect and the ending of which we recollect.  We remember
with what zeal it was prosecuted; we remember how summarily
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P161"></a>161}</span>
it was dropped; we remember also what reparation has been
done within the last few days to the distinguished man who was
the immediate object of that controversy.  But does anybody
who hears me believe that the controversy so prosecuted and so
abandoned was beneficial to the Christian Religion?
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Throughout that controversy, his fellow-member for
Northampton was his loyal colleague both in the country
and the House.  In season and out of season Mr. Labouchere
spoke, moved, and agitated until the victory, to which
his advocacy was so important a contribution, was won,
and, after Bradlaugh's death in 1891, he published the
following paragraphs in the pages of <i>Truth</i>, bearing witness
to the nobility of Bradlaugh's character:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
Mr. Bradlaugh was a man of herculean physical strength, but
of great nervous susceptibility.  I believe that he never entirely
recovered from the rough usage which he met with when he
sought to force his way into the House of Commons.  Last year
he had a serious illness.  He recovered, but he came out of it a
broken man.  He would not, however, admit this, and he struggled
on in the House of Commons, at public meetings, and at his
desk, with the sad result that we all know.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Never was a man less understood.  I never knew any one with
a stronger sense of public decorum or with a deeper respect for
law.  When he asked leave to affirm in the House of Commons
it was said by some that he was seeking notoriety; by others,
that he wished to defy the law.  What led to it was this: I was
sitting by his side when the Parliament of 1881 met, and he
said to me, "I shall ask to be allowed to affirm, as with my views
this would be more decorous than for me to take the oath."  I
replied, "Are you sure that you legally can affirm?"  "Yes," he
answered; "I have looked closely into the matter and I am
satisfied of my legal right."  His attempt to affirm was, therefore,
solely due to a desire to respect the feelings of others, and
to the conviction that the law allowed him to do so.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Mr. Bradlaugh was my colleague for ten years.  During
all these years our relations, political and personal, were always
of the most cordial character.  He was in private life a thoroughly
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P162"></a>162}</span>
true and amiable man, whilst in public life he was ever ready to
sacrifice popularity to his convictions of what was right.  He was,
as is known, an atheist, but his standard of duty was a very high
one, and he lived up to it.  His life was an example to Christians,
for he abounded in every Christian virtue.  This the House of
Commons came at last to recognise.  I do not think that there
is a single member more popular or more respected than he was
on both sides.  Often and often Conservatives have, in a friendly
way, said to me: "What a much better man your colleague is
than you are!"  And I heartily agreed with them.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Regarding money, he was more than disinterested.  So that
he had enough to pay for his food, his clothes, and for his modest
lodging in St. John's Wood, he never seemed to trouble himself
as to ways and means.  In one part of his life he had been led
into some sort of commercial enterprise which did not succeed,
and the failure resulted in his owing a considerable sum.  He
called his creditors together, told them that he had nothing, but
if they would agree to wait he would pay them twenty shillings
in the pound.  They trusted him.  He went to America, made
the money by lecturing; returned, called them together, and
fulfilled his promise.  His lodgings in St. John's Wood were over
a music shop.  They consisted of one or two bedrooms and of a
large room, with deal shelves round it for his books, an old bureau
where he wrote, and a few chairs and tables.  He had a great
affection for his books, and the only time I ever saw him
disquieted about money matters was when he feared that he might
have to give them up, owing to some bankruptcy proceedings
that were threatened, in consequence of one of his numerous
actions on the oath question.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
In an article, published in the <i>Northampton Echo</i> just
after the death of Mr. Labouchere, that able writer,
Mr. C. A. McCurdy, comments thus on the first Radical members
for Northampton:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
What a strangely assorted pair Northampton's two members
were in those days!  Bradlaugh, a giant in stature as in intellect,
Boanergian in his oratory, tremendous in the strength of it,
sweeping away opposition by the force of its torrent&mdash;Labouchere,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P163"></a>163}</span>
with his slight figure, his quiet, sardonic manner, wielding
a rapier which was sometimes even more deadly than the battle-axe
and broadsword of his colleague.  His aristocratic connections
and his wealth accentuated the clear and strong outline of
his Radicalism.  His disregard of convention, his simplicity, his
courage, his irrepressible gaiety and wit, the audacity of his
envenomed personal assaults, the passionless quality of it all,
the cynic's pose&mdash;all this, combined with his encyclopædic
knowledge and the sureness of his aim in controversy, made him
the idol of Northampton Radicals.  How they laughed at his
solemn assumption of moderation and orthodoxy!  But how
sure they were of his earnestness and conviction!  And how
proud of his easy triumphs in the battles of the wits, of his courage
and resource in the conflicts of Parliament and the political fame
which he, working loyally with Bradlaugh, helped to win for
Northampton![<a id="chap07fn6text"></a><a href="#chap07fn6">6</a>]
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
It is impossible before leaving the subject of Mr. Bradlaugh's
struggle for liberty of conscience, not to recall the
very similar episode of Wilkes' fight with the House of
Commons a little more than a hundred years earlier.
Mr. Labouchere, speaking in the House on the occasion of
Bradlaugh's presenting himself to take the oath, after his
re-election in 1884, pointed out that behind his colleague
stood the people of England.  He continued: "I do not say
this from any feeling of regard or affection for Mr. Bradlaugh.
as an individual; assume if you like that Mr. Bradlaugh is,
the vilest of men [Mr. Warton, Hear, hear!], as was stated
by Mr. Wilkes, 'in attacking the rights of the vilest of men
you have attacked the rights of the most noble of mankind.'"[<a id="chap07fn7text"></a><a href="#chap07fn7">7</a>]
Bradlaugh established the principle that legislative rights
are wholly independent of religious belief, and that what
Drummond Wolff called "the distinct negation of anything
like perpetual morality or conscience and the existence of
God," does not affect a man's capacity for the exercise of
his political rights.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P164"></a>164}</span>
</p>

<p>
This means that the modern state is non-theistic, and
that our civilisation, of which the state is the political
expression, is based on those positive social needs of man to which
theological problems, however interesting in themselves,
are irrelevant.  Thus, in Bradlaugh's victory, to the
winning of which Mr. Labouchere so powerfully contributed,
one of the most important principles of 1789 was definitely
ratified by the representatives of the people, the Lords,
spiritual and temporal, and the sovereign of this country.
</p>

<p>
A truly momentous event, the importance of which it
would be hard to overestimate.  For it means that God has
ceased to exist in England as a political entity.  In like
manner, the action of Wilkes, in severely criticising the
Speech from the Throne in the <i>North Briton</i> for April 23,
1762, and condemning the Ministers who were responsible
for its production, raised, and settled for ever in England the
question of the political position of the sovereign.  In both
cases the man who dared to raise such points was pursued
rancorously and unfairly by the partisans of officialdom, in
both cases the utmost force of law and order arrayed against
him failed.  The enemies of Wilkes and Bradlaugh failed,
because the stars in their courses fought against them&mdash;because
the time had gone by when kings could rule as well
as reign, or when the qualification of religious belief was
necessary for the full rights of citizenship.

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
<br><br>
LABOUCHERE AND IRELAND
</h3>

<p class="t3">
1881-1883
</p>

<p>
When Lord Cowper, the Irish Viceroy, under the influence
of the Chief Secretary, Mr. Forster, represented
to Mr. Gladstone in the early autumn of 1880 the necessity
of coercive measures for the government of Ireland, he found
the Prime Minister profoundly opposed to departure from
the ordinary law.  The Viceroy was pressed to suspend the
Habeas Corpus Act by every agent, every landlord, every
magistrate in the country.  The number of outrages against
life and property had increased <i>pari passu</i> with the number
of evictions.  The Land League, which had been formed,
under the presidency of Parnell, the preceding year, had
taken up the cause of the evicted tenants and, by establishing
the elaborate system of persecution, named after its
first victim, Lord Mayo's English agent, Captain Boycott,
rendered it almost impossible to let farms from which a
tenant had been evicted.  When, on September 25, Lord
Mountmorres, a poor man with a small estate, who could
really not afford to reduce his rents, was murdered, such
was the popular detestation of the murdered man that the
owner of the nearest house refused shelter to the corpse, no
hearse could be obtained to convey it to the grave, and the
family had to fly to England.  The maiming of cattle, a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P166"></a>166}</span>
method of reprisal constantly adopted by evicted tenants,
further contributed to inflame English opinion, both in and
out of Ireland, against the Nationalist party, who were held
responsible by the man in the street for everything that was
going on.  Mr. Bright was still more opposed than
Mr. Gladstone to the repeal of the Habeas Corpus, and so was
Mr. Chamberlain, who had joined the Government as
President of the Board of Trade.  Before giving way to
Mr. Forster, the Cabinet determined to use the ordinary methods
of law, and prosecuted the heads of the Land League for
"conspiring to prevent the payment of rent, resist the
process of eviction, and obstruct the letting of surrendered
farms."  The public announcement of the prosecution in
no way intimidated the Land League.  The prosecution,
although announced on November 3, did not, on account
of legal delays, begin until after Christmas.  Disorder at
once became more rampant and outrages more frequent.
On November 23, Cowper wrote again to Mr. Gladstone,
threatening his resignation in the following January, if he
were not given fuller powers.  On December 12, he made
his last appeal, urging that Parliament should be immediately
summoned.  Mr. Gladstone yielded the very day before
the trial of the Land League began in Dublin, and summoned
Parliament for January 6, 1881.
</p>

<p>
On the first night of the session Mr. Forster gave notice
of the introduction of Bills for the protection of life and
property in Ireland.  But the Irish members had taken the
phrase in the Queen's Speech that "additional powers are
required by the Irish Government for the protection of life
and property," as a declaration of war, and commenced
the policy of obstruction of which they were afterwards to
make so powerful a weapon.  They succeeded in protracting
the debate on the Address for eleven days.
</p>

<p>
Forster's case was a very simple one.  The Land League
was supreme, and its power must be crippled.  This could
only be done by extending the range of the executive.  With
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P167"></a>167}</span>
the suspension of Habeas Corpus the authors of the outrages,
who were known to the police, could be arrested and the
course of justice would not be interfered with by corrupt
evidence.  It was the point of view of the official responsible
for public order, that and nothing more.  Mr. Parnell's
view pierced the surface facts of the case.  The League did
nothing but organise and express the public opinion of
Ireland.  The Government's policy was simply one of
coercion, that is, of violence.  Although it was admitted
that wrongs were endured, the Government's policy did
not include any method of redressing those wrongs.  Eviction
of tenants who could not possibly pay their rent through
no fault of their own was palpable injustice.  Let that
injustice be put an end to, and outrages would soon cease.
It was clearly the duty of the representatives of Ireland to
put every difficulty in the way of the passing of such a
measure as the Chief Secretary's.
</p>

<p>
At this stage of his career Mr. Labouchere was not a
Home Ruler.  In his first speech to his electors at
Northampton,[<a id="chap08fn1text"></a><a href="#chap08fn1">1</a>] he had said: "I really have not understood myself
what Home Rule means.  I should be exceedingly sorry to
see the Union between Great Britain and Ireland done away
with.  I think it is absolutely necessary for the well-being
of both countries, but I am myself in favour of as much
local government, not only in Ireland, but in all parts of
England as possible."  He was voicing the views of
Mr. Chamberlain, whose trumpet from the beginning had set
forth no uncertain sound, for the member for Birmingham
was then, and remained, unalterably opposed to the
separation of the two kingdoms, and to the institution of an
Independent Parliament in Dublin.
</p>

<p>
On January 27, Forster's Bill for the Protection of Life
and Property in Ireland having been introduced three days
previously, Mr. Labouchere, speaking in favour of an amendment
introduced in his name to the effect "that no Bill for
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P168"></a>168}</span>
the Protection of Life and Property in Ireland will be
satisfactory which does not include protection to the tenant in
cases where it can be shown, to the satisfaction of a Court
of Justice, that the tenant's rent is excessive or that he is
unable, owing to temporary circumstances, to pay it," said
that, while he was a genuine supporter of the Prime Minister,
he did not intend to rain down blessings on that gentleman's
head that evening.  He found himself occupying a singular
position.  He was returned there as a Radical by a very
advanced constituency, and, to his surprise, he found himself
almost alone with his colleague as an advocate of Conservatism
in the real, though not in the party, sense of the word.
He was there to defend the Habeas Corpus.  He was ready
to admit that Englishmen had many virtues, but they were
somewhat intolerant, and they were curiously intolerant
when any country under their rule ventured to have the
same virtues as themselves.  There was nothing they valued
so highly as self-government, and yet, when Ireland asked for
self-government in local matters, they regarded the demand
as something monstrous and intolerable.  The Chief Secretary
had urged that the Bill must be passed as quickly as possible
on account of outrages!  He must remember that there were
such things as standing orders, and that honourable gentlemen
opposite would be able to delay the Bill for a considerable
time....  It was taking a really too Arcadian view
of human nature to suppose that honourable gentlemen
opposite would not use&mdash;or even misuse&mdash;every standing
order of the House to prevent the passing of such a Bill.
The right honourable gentleman seemed to have thought,
in pleading urgency, that the Irish members would act like
the "dilly, dilly ducks" which came to be killed when they
were called.  The reports of the outrages had come from
magistrates most of whom were landowners, and from police
constables; and they knew in England how to judge of
constables' evidence.  (Oh! oh!)  He quoted a return.
"Injured persons were Margaret Lydon, Patrick Whalem, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P169"></a>169}</span>
Bridget Whalem.  It appeared that: A dispute arose about
the possession of a small plot of ground, and John Lydon
assaulted the injured persons.  Yet, in the very next case,
John Lydon appeared as the injured person, because he was
assaulted as the time of the above dispute by his own wife.
This was obviously a little domestic difference between a
husband and his spouse, yet it was converted into two
separate outrages.  As regarded cattle maiming, it was no
new thing.  Dean Swift jeered at his countrymen on the
subject.  'Did they, like Don Quixote, look on a flock of
sheep as an army?'"  Labouchere wound up his speech,
after pointing out the danger of the Chief Secretary's
"hideous doctrine of constructive treason" and animadverting
on the idea of making use of secret informers, whom he
regarded as "the lowest, vilest, and most contemptible of
the human race," by stating that the purpose of the Bill
was not to suppress outrages or exclusive dealing, but solely
to enable landlords to collect their rents.[<a id="chap08fn2text"></a><a href="#chap08fn2">2</a>]  Mr. Serjeant
Simon retorted in his defence of the Bill, not quite unjustly
perhaps, that Mr. Labouchere's speech had been more
facetious than fair, more humorous than consistent.
Certainly the John Lydon mixed outrage was a hardly
representative specimen of the statistics before the House.  The
O'Donoghue, on the other hand, had listened to the speech
with great pleasure, and felt sure it would be received with
satisfaction by a larger circle outside the constituency of
Northampton when public opinion in England and Scotland
came to be enlightened on this subject.  Labouchere
continued to argue against the Bill in Committee in every
imaginable way.  Much of his argument was mere heckling
of Mr. Forster.  He was always a little inclined to confuse
the floor of the House with the hustings, a state of mind
which sometimes deprived his speeches of the persuasive
value that their argumentative ability deserved.  Every
now and then he made a crushing point against the Government.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P170"></a>170}</span>
"The Home Secretary (Sir William Harcourt)," he
said, "had incited a prejudice against the Land League by
quoting what the Fenians had done in America.  He had
read a speech from a Mr. Devoy, an American Fenian, to
the effect that he had contemplated blowing up the entire
Government of this country, most of the towns in this country
and the capital, and, is this monster, the Home Secretary
had asked, to be allowed to say these things without protest?
He had pointed out the terrible consequences of this speech:
how a certain Patrick Stewart immediately subscribed the
sum of one dollar that these intentions might be carried out....
Such men as Redpath (another American Fenian) and
Devoy, the Right Honourable gentleman told them, would
'come over to Ireland, and the Bill is intended for those
gentlemen.'  Surely," pursued Mr. Labouchere blandly,
"the Right Honourable gentleman was an eminent authority
on international law and must be aware that, if these
Americans were to come over to Ireland, and if they were to
be taken up on mere suspicion and put in prison for eighteen
months without being told, or without their Minister in
England being told, for what they were put in prison, we
should get, and rightly too, into considerable difficulty with
the American Government.  (Sir William Harcourt: No!)  The
Right Honourable gentleman said no.  Perhaps he
meant that he would get us out of the difficulty.  But
would it not have been better to have brought in an Aliens
Bill than to suspend the Habeas Corpus in Ireland?  It was
a strange thing to suspend the Habeas Corpus in Ireland,
because an American had made a speech in America."[<a id="chap08fn3text"></a><a href="#chap08fn3">3</a>]  This
characteristic speech is a very good specimen of
Labouchere's method in attack.  His manner was one of
irresponsible persiflage, stinging and exasperating those of his
opponents whom it failed to amuse,[<a id="chap08fn4text"></a><a href="#chap08fn4">4</a>] his matter both sound
and serious.  It would have been difficult to have summed up
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P171"></a>171}</span>
Forster's Bill better than Labouchere did in the following
list of "Alleged advantages and real disadvantages of the
Bill."  (1) Alleged advantages: (<i>a</i>) it would drive a certain
number of crazy Fenians out of Ireland.  (<i>b</i>) It would lead
to the imprisonment of certain village ruffians who probably
deserve it.  (<i>c</i>) It would enable landlords to collect their
rents.  (2) Disadvantages: (<i>a</i>) It would do away with the
useful action of the Land League.  (<i>b</i>) It would enable the
landlords not only to collect their rents from men who could
pay them, but also to evict from their small holdings men
who could not&mdash;the very thing the Land League had been
preventing.  (<i>c</i>) It would alienate all classes in Ireland from
the English connection.  (<i>d</i>) It would substitute secret
societies for the open society called the Land League.
(<i>e</i>) The Government would be playing into the hands of the
Fenians, who would acquire an influence they did not then
possess.  Certainly it would have been difficult to prophesy
more accurately what were the actual consequences of the
passing of the Coercion Bill.  He concluded his speech on
this occasion by warning the Irish members not to persevere
in a policy of obstruction, both on account of the prejudice
it created against them and on account of the excellence of
their cause.  Let that cause be stated fairly and honestly
to the English people&mdash;let it be allowed to stand on its own
merits.  He believed many people in England were already
very much inclined to take the same view as many Irishmen
on Irish matters.  There were many points on which the
democracy of England and Ireland ought to unite.  He
therefore hoped that honourable gentlemen opposite would
not be carried away by the irritation of the moment.  He
hated the Coercion Bill as much as they did, but he could not
shut his eyes to the fact that the Liberals, not the Conservatives,
had done the best for Ireland, and he wound up with a
eulogy in this connection of the "two patron saints of my
political calendar"&mdash;Mr. Gladstone and Mr. Bright.[<a id="chap08fn5text"></a><a href="#chap08fn5">5</a>]
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P172"></a>172}</span>
</p>

<p>
The Arms Bill&mdash;or the Peace Preservation Bill, as it was
called&mdash;by which the Coercion Bill was promptly followed,
was another target for Mr. Labouchere's darts.  He pointed
out the suspicious nature of the support given by the
Opposition to the Government, which delayed the introduction of
Liberal legislation for England and widened the breach
between the Liberal party and the Irish.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the most serious and immediate consequence
of the Coercion Act was the arrest of Parnell, which took
place on October 13.  This event, which caused frenzied
joy in England, was one of Forster's worst mistakes in
Ireland.  The Land League at once issued a "No rent"
manifesto.  It was signed by Parnell, Dillon, Sexton, and
Brennan, who were all in Kilmainham Gaol, and Egan, the
treasurer of the League at Paris.  Forster, not sorry to be
able to do so, retorted by proclaiming the League an illegal
association, the legality of which proceeding was doubtful,
according to Lord Eversley.  It had been impossible to
convict the League of a violation of the law and the Coercion
Act contained no clause authorising its suppression.  On
the other hand, the "No rent" manifesto was also an obvious
blunder.  The clergy denounced it from every altar in
Ireland, as indeed they could hardly help doing, and only
in the west, where large bodies of the poorer tenants were
already refusing to pay their rents without deduction, did
it take effect.  The agrarian war was consequently intensified,
and English opinion greatly incensed.  The local heads
of the League were arrested all over the disturbed areas,
and the Coercion Act pressed into the service of landlords
to enable them to collect their rents, no matter how excessive
they might be.  Evictions were naturally multiplied.  Most
serious consequence of all&mdash;and directly traceable to the
ill-advised arrest of Parnell and the leaders of the Land
League&mdash;secret societies, with their inevitable accompaniment
of crime and outrage, began to take the place of open
and, at least relatively, constitutional agitation.  Parnell
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P173"></a>173}</span>
had been asked by an admirer, who would take his place in
case of his arrest.  "Captain Moonlight will take my place,"
was his grim reply.  Captain Moonlight did so.  During
the months preceding the passing of the Coercion Act there
were seven homicides, twenty-one cases of firing at the
person, and sixty-two of firing into dwellings.
</p>

<p>
The work of the suppressed Land League was carried on
by the Ladies' Land League under the presidency of Parnell's
sister.  The ladies, if they did not actually stimulate crime,
did little to suppress it.  When Parnell eventually emerged
from Kilmainham, he was furious with them, both on
account of their policy and their extravagance.  Outrages
had increased, and they had spent £70,000 during the seven
months of his incarceration!
</p>

<p>
The Coercion Act had evidently failed to produce the
results expected.  Nevertheless, Forster and Lord Cowper
could think of nothing but more coercion.  Gladstone
refused to accede to their proposals.  He had never liked
coercion himself, and his hands were strengthened by the
support of Chamberlain in the Cabinet, who was energetically
backed in the press by John Morley, then editing the
<i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>.  Meanwhile Parnell, realising that his
prolonged detention at Kilmainham was damaging his cause,
entered into negotiations with the Government by means of
Captain O'Shea; and although Mr. Gladstone was, no doubt,
literally truthful in denying the existence of any formal
"treaty," an understanding was reached between the Government
and the Irish leader.  The main source of unrest and
disorder in the country was, according to Parnell, the smaller
tenants, some 100,000 in number, who were utterly unable
to pay the arrears of rent due from them, and were, in
consequence, liable at any moment to eviction.  The Government
must deal in a generous and statesmanlike way with
the lot of these unhappy people.  Parnell, if free to resume
an effective leadership, would be able to do much to curb
the criminal forces set in motion by the secret societies.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P174"></a>174}</span>
On May 2, Parnell and his companions were released from
Kilmainham, and Forster and Lord Cowper at once resigned.
</p>

<p>
Forster made his statement in the House on May 4.
It was to the effect that the state of the country did not
justify the release of Parnell without a new Coercion Act.
Just as he had uttered the following words, "There are two
warrants which I signed in regard to the member for the
City of Cork&mdash;" Parnell entered the House.  It was a
dramatic scene.  Deafening cheers broke from the Irish
benches, drowning Forster's voice and preventing the
conclusion of the sentence from being heard.  Parnell quickly
surveyed the situation, and, bowing to the Speaker, passed
"with head erect and measured tread to his place, the victor
of the House."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Gladstone answered Forster, saying that the
circumstances which had warranted Parnell's arrest no longer
existed, and that "he had an assurance that if the Government
dealt with the arrears question, the three members
released would range themselves on the side of law and
order."  Parnell then intervened, saying that he had in no
way suggested any bargain with the Prime Minister, but
that there could be no doubt that a settlement of the arrears
question would have an enormous effect in the restoration of
law and order, and would take away the last excuse for outrage.
</p>

<p>
Irish prospects had not looked brighter in the House for
many a year, but, unfortunately, only two days after the
memorable afternoon on which Mr. Gladstone dissociated
himself from his sometime Irish Minister and threw himself
into Parnell's arms, England was horrified by a terrible
tragedy.  Lord Spencer and Lord Frederick Cavendish had
been appointed to the vacant offices of Lord Cowper and
Mr. Forster.  The new Chief Secretary and Mr. Burke,
permanent Under-Secretary, were murdered close to the
Vice-regal Lodge in Phœnix Park, on the evening following
Lord Spencer's state entry into Dublin.  Mr. O'Brien, in
his <i>Life of Parnell</i>, says that "Cavendish was killed simply
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P175"></a>175}</span>
through the accident of his being with Mr. Burke, whose
death was the real object of the assassins."[<a id="chap08fn6text"></a><a href="#chap08fn6">6</a>]  No one was
more overwhelmed by the tragedy than Parnell himself.
"How can I," he said, "carry on a public agitation if I am
stabbed in the back in this way?"
</p>

<p>
The House met on the 8th, and Parnell made a short,
straightforward speech, condemning the outrages in
unqualified terms.  He also expressed the fear that the
Government would feel themselves obliged, under the circumstances,
to revert to coercion.  His fear was justified, and on May 11,
the Home Secretary, Sir William Harcourt, introduced a
Crimes Bill, based on previous suggestions of Lord Cowper.
</p>

<p>
It is easy to see now that this proceeding was a mistake.
It should have been evident to any unbiassed observer that,
far from Parnell and the League being responsible for
outrages, whether agrarian or political, it was during the
imprisonment of Parnell and after the dissolution of the League
that they increased and finally led up to the tragedy of
Phœnix Park.  But the Government had to count with
English opinion, which was exasperated by the murder of
Burke and Cavendish almost to the point of hysteria.  To
most English people Ireland was little more than a
geographical expression; in so far as it connoted anything else,
it bored and disgusted them.  Parnell indicated the true
inwardness of Mr. Gladstone's altered attitude in a speech
on May 20, in which he said: "I regret that the event in
Phœnix Park has prevented him (Mr. Gladstone) continuing
the course of conciliation that we had expected from him.
I regret that, owing to the exigencies of his party, of his
position in the country, he has felt himself compelled to turn
from that course of conciliation and concession into the
horrible paths of coercion."
</p>

<p>
Labouchere took Mr. Parnell's view of the situation,
and argued with much zest against the worst features of the
Crimes Bill.  Speaking on May 18, on the second reading,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P176"></a>176}</span>
he said that it was clear from the fact that the House was
now asked to pass a remedial measure (the Arrears Bill) and
a Coercion Bill that the former policy of the Government
had been a failure.
</p>

<p>
But the present Coercion Bill erred precisely in the same
direction that the other had done, because it was not aimed
solely at outrage, but was directed at honourable members
sitting opposite.  In fact he (Mr. Labouchere) could see the
trail of the honourable member for Bradford (Mr. W. E. Forster)
and of his policy in this measure.  The Government
ought to try to get the majority of the Irish people on their
side to fight with them against outrage.  Was this Bill
likely to enlist the sympathies of the Irish members?
Mr. Labouchere expressed the principle of his objection to the
Bill by saying that as long as political and criminal elements
were mixed up in the Bill he could not vote for it.  He
objected particularly to the following features.  The "intimidation
clause" went too far, being directed against boycotting,
which, although it had its bad features, was, as a system
of exclusive trading, legitimate.  He considered it "monstrous"
that the authorities should have power to detain any
person out after sunset.  He objected to the clause dealing
with the press, and he thought that three years was too long
a period for the Bill to remain in force.  Who could say who
might be Lord-Lieutenant in three years?  He could not
imagine anything more horrible than that, say, the right
honourable gentleman the member for North Lincolnshire
(Mr. J. Lowther) should be invested with the powers of the
Bill.  The consequence would perhaps be, that if the Prime
Minister went over to Ireland, he would be arrested and put
into prison.  His admiration for the Prime Minister was
increasing, but all his colleagues were not as well minded as
himself.  There seemed to be two currents in the cabinet&mdash;
some members who desired to do all they could for Ireland
being baulked by those of their colleagues called Whigs.[<a id="chap08fn7text"></a><a href="#chap08fn7">7</a>]
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P177"></a>177}</span>
Mr. Labouchere worked out of Parliament, as well as in,
for the improvement of the Bill.  He was incessantly
negotiating both with the Government and the Irish leaders to
defeat what he felt to be its impossible features and to modify
the remaining ones in the direction of conciliation.  He had
written two days before the speech just mentioned to
Mr. Chamberlain as follows:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
10 QUEEN ANNE'S GATE, May 16, 1882.
</p>

<p class="quote">
DEAR CHAMBERLAIN,&mdash;I enclose Bill with Healy's amendments.
He says that what he means in the suggested changes
in the Intimidation Clause is, that only a person who actually
threatens a person with injury should come under the provisions
of the Bill.  What he objects to is constructive intimidation.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I went through the Bill thus amended with Parnell.  He
agrees with them in the main, but would like to have the opinion
of a lawyer with regard to them.  Like Healy, his chief objection
is to constructive intimidation.  He says that if the Government
will meet him and his party in the conciliatory spirit of the
amendments, he will promise that the opposition to the Bill shall
be conducted on honest Parliamentary lines, and that there shall
be no abstention.  He specially urges that the Bill shall only be
in operation until the close of next session; he puts this on two
grounds: (1) That the Tories may possibly come in at the end
of that time.  (2) That he may be able to advise the Irish to be
quiet in the hopes of no renewal of the Bill.
</p>

<p class="quote">
He says that he is in a very difficult position between the
Government and the secret societies.  The latter, he says, are
more numerous than are supposed; that most of those connected
with them only wish to be let alone, but that he greatly fears that
if they are disgusted they will commit outrages.  The late
murders, he seems to think, were, when agrarian, the acts of men
who had a grudge against a particular individual, and, when
political, the acts of skirmishers from America.  I really think
that he is most anxious to be able to support the Government;
he fully admits that a Bill is necessary on account of English
opinion, but he does not wish to have it applied to himself, and
he doubts whether it will be really effectual against the outrage
mongers.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P178"></a>178}</span>
</p>

<p class="quote">
Healy goes so far as to say that if the Prime Minister or you
were to administer the Bill it would do no harm, and that he is
not greatly afraid of it in the hands of Lord Spencer, but that it
would be a monstrous weapon of oppression in the hands of Jim
Lowther.  I am sure that with conciliation you can now, for
the first time, get the Parnellites on your side.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
This letter Mr. Chamberlain sent to Mr. Gladstone,
promising to bring the draft of the Bill to the House that
afternoon.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Labouchere continued to Mr. Chamberlain on the
following day:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
He (Healy) points out that even the Conservative newspapers
are against the Newspaper Clause, and he wants it made
applicable only to newspapers printed out of Ireland.  With
regard to the Search Clause, he will make a fight for nominative
warrants, and he also wants an amendment securing an indemnity
in case of injury done to property by the searchers.  He points
out that there ought to be a right of appeal from the County
Court Judge to the Queen's Bench.  With respect to the Intimidation
Clause, he seems to approve of cutting out the definition
clause, but is very anxious for some restriction in the terms of
the clause, so that there may be no crime of constructive
intimidation.
</p>

<p class="quote">
There is to be a private meeting at one to-morrow of himself,
Parnell, T. P. O'Connor, and Sexton.  He will say to them that
he thinks that Government will agree to the County Court
Judges and to the period of the Bill being shortened.  He will,
however, before the meeting, go further into details as regards
the position with Parnell.  He is most desirous that there should
be no plea for saying that there is a bargain of any kind.  I have
told him that, in the Prime Minister, they have a friend, but that
they must take into consideration his position as the leader of a
Government where possibly all are not as well disposed, and as
the head of a country where there is a popular outcry for stringent
measures.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
On May 22, he wrote again, after a further interview
with Parnell:
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P179"></a>179}</span>
</p>

<p class="quote">
This is about the sum total of what Parnell took an hour to
tell me.  He does not in the least complain of you, and really is
most anxious to get on with the Government if possible.  He
wants me to let him know as soon as possible to-morrow whether
he is to consider that there is to be no concession.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Parnell says: That the Arrears Bill has been very well received
in Ireland, and that, if it be followed by one making certain
modifications of no very important character in the Land Bill,
he is convinced that the situation will greatly improve, provided
that concessions be made in the Coercion Bill.
</p>

<p class="quote">
He suggests that the Coercion and the Arrears Bill move
forward <i>pari passu</i>, and that only small progress be made with
the Coercion Bill before Whitsuntide, in order to give time
for the passions to cool, and for persons to see by experience that
the condition of Ireland is not so bad as is supposed.
</p>

<p class="quote">
If urgency is to be voted on the Coercion Bill, he asks that
it should be voted by a simple majority, and that it should be
stated that it will be used whenever any Legislative measures in
regard to Ireland are brought forward during the Session and
obstructed by the Conservatives.
</p>

<p class="quote">
He greatly regrets the speech of Davitt, but says that he
(Davitt) has no intention to go to Ireland, and that his land
scheme is a little fad of his own.
</p>

<p class="quote">
He says that he is most anxious for a <i>modus vivendi</i>, and believes
that if the present opportunity for establishing one be let
pass, it is not likely to recur.  He and his friends, he says, are
incurring the serious risk of assassination in their efforts to bring
it about, and he thinks that his suggestions ought to be judged on
their merits, but that, with the Coercion Act as it is, there will
be so much anger and ill-feeling in Ireland, that all alliance with
the Liberal party will be impossible.
</p>

<p class="quote">
He points out, not as a matter of bargain, but as a fact, that
the Liberals may&mdash;if only there be concessions on the Coercion
Bill, and a few modifications in the Land Bill&mdash;count on the
Irish vote, as against the Conservatives, and suggests that this
will make the Government absolutely safe, even though there
be Whig defections.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Mr. Labouchere continued, as will be seen by the following
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P180"></a>180}</span>
letters to Mr. Chamberlain, to press the views of the
Irish leaders upon the Government.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
10 QUEEN ANNE'S GATE, June 3, 1882.
</p>

<p class="quote">
DEAR CHAMBERLAIN,&mdash;We have done our best during your
absence to hold our own against Harcourt.  The only important
issue yet raised has been the exclusion of treason and treason
felony from the Bill.
</p>

<p class="quote">
On Thursday I went to Grosvenor from Parnell to ask that
the debate should be adjourned.  Gladstone said that Parnell
ought to consider that after Harcourt's "no surrender" speech
the Government would not be able to give in the next day, and
that the division if taken would be larger on Thursday than on
Friday, and that the matter might be reconsidered in Report.
I said that if Government would give any private assurance, or
if Gladstone would say in the House, that the exclusion would be
favourably considered on Report, he could have the division at
once.  This latter he was afraid to do, for Harcourt, as sulky as
a bear, was glaring at him.  He therefore agreed to consent
"with regret" to the adjournment.  When, however, Parnell
moved it, our idiots and the Conservatives shouted so loudly
"no," that a division had to be taken.  Then Healy moved it,
on which Gladstone did hint at the Report, but said nothing
definite, except that it would be impossible to consult at once
with the Irish Executive.  The next day, Grosvenor wrote to me
to say that he spoke without prejudice and held out no hope, but
would I call "Parnell's attention to one sentence in one of
Gladstone's concluding speeches, which was to the effect that it was
impossible to call the attention of the Irish Government to the
question of omitting treason and treason felony, between last
night and this day, and therefore it would be better to bring up
the question again on Report.  Please ask Parnell to consider
this fact."
</p>

<p class="quote">
On Friday morning the Irish held a meeting, and they agreed
to keep what they did secret, decided that if treason were retained,
at least treason felony should be eliminated.
</p>

<p class="quote">
On the House meeting Trevelyan tackled me, and said: "I
am opposed to the insertion of treason and treason felony, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P181"></a>181}</span>
I am disposed to make large concessions.  You know that I am
a person of strong will.  I now understand the Bill, and you will
see how I shall act."
</p>

<p class="quote">
Grosvenor also said that I need not believe him, as he
quite agreed with me, but that Harcourt was the difficulty.
I asked him whether he would agree that if Lord Spencer said
that treason and treason felony were not needed, they should
be struck out on Report.  He replied that the onus could not
be thrown on Spencer, but that it must be the act of the
Cabinet.
</p>

<p class="quote">
So after seeing Parnell it was agreed that the division should
be taken at 7.30.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Why Parnell is making such a fight over this, and will make
a fight over the Intimidation Clause, is that unless concession be
made, he will find it difficult to hold his own.  Egan, he says,
wants to carry on the agitation from Paris, in which case it will
be illegal; he wants to carry it on in Dublin, in which case it will
be legal.  If concessions are made he will have his way; if not,
Egan will remain the master in Paris.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Grosvenor quite admits that it is most desirable to aid Parnell
to remain leader.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Parnell says:
</p>

<p class="quote">
"I ask, in order to put an end definitely to the land agitation:
that a clause should be introduced into the Arrears Bill, allowing
small tenants in the Land Court to pay on Griffiths' valuation
until their cases are decided: that there should be an expansion
of the Bright Clauses next year if not this; and that a Royal
Commission be appointed to keep the agricultural labourers
quiet by taking evidence.  Then I propose to ask for a fair and
reasonable measure of local self-government, such as an English
Government can grant," and he assures me that in all questions
between me and the Conservatives and the Liberals, the latter
shall have the Irish vote.  I believe that he is perfectly sincere,
and that he is thoroughly frightened by threats of assassination;
indeed he told me that he never went about without a revolver
in his pocket, and even then did not feel safe.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I write you all this for your private information, as you may
wish to know the exact situation at present.&mdash;Yours truly,

<p class="quote">
REFORM CLUB, June 8, 1882.
</p>

<p class="quote">
DEAR CHAMBERLAIN&mdash;Parnell says that it is absolutely
necessary that something should be understood, and that if no
concession be made on the Intimidation Clause, he considers
that things revert to where they were under the Forster regime,
and that they will fight until urgency is voted and then fight on
urgency until a <i>coup d'état</i> is carried out.  Allowing for some
exaggeration, a simple consideration of his position towards his
party shows that this programme is necessarily forced upon him.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Surely we have a right to see the clause as Government will
agree to it, before passing a portion of it.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I believe that this would be agreed to: that intimidation shall
mean any threats, etc., to violence, any boycotting which involves
danger such, for instance, as a doctor refusing to attend a sick
man, or a refusal to supply the necessaries of life, and any specific
act that is set out in the Bill, but <i>nothing more</i>.
</p>

<p class="quote">
C. Russell, Bryce, and Davy are trying their hands at this
and hope to be able to frame a clause on these lines.  You will
no doubt see that, if something cannot be done to-morrow, the
fat will be in the fire.  Would it not therefore be well to leave
the clause until the other clauses are passed, and then bring it
on?&mdash;Yours truly,

</p>

<p class="quote">
DEAR CHAMBERLAIN,&mdash;I wrote you a line in a great hurry
last night, but after the House had adjourned I again saw Parnell.
</p>

<p class="quote">
He is most anxious that Mr. Gladstone should not think
that obstruction arises from any ill-feeling towards him, and
that he does not, in his own interests, wish it to be thought that
anything in the nature of a bargain is to be made.
</p>

<p class="quote">
But he wants Mr. Gladstone to know facts.  He says that
there are two sections in the Land League.  The funds of the
League are at Paris, where a large sum is invested in securities.
Egan wishes to trench on these securities, but Parnell and Davitt
have been able to stop this, and at present nothing is expended
but the weekly contributions.  Egan and his section of the
League are furious at the idea of the League being converted
into a moderate tenant right Association, with its headquarters
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P183"></a>183}</span>
in Dublin.  This he desires.  Every day the ultras of his party
are telling him that nothing is gained by conciliation.  If the
Bill is to be passed in its present shape, he declares that neither
he nor his friends can have anything to do with a moderate policy,
and, as they absolutely decline to associate themselves with
Egan and his desperate courses, they must withdraw.
</p>

<p class="quote">
The result, he says, will be that the Fenians will be masters
of the situation, that they will have funds, and that there will be
assassinations and outrages all over Ireland.  So soon as he
withdraws, he considers that his own life will not be worth a day's
purchase.
</p>

<p class="quote">
If he is able to head the tenant right Association, he considers
that he can crush out the Fenians&mdash;more especially if something
is done in the Arrears Bill to meet the difficulty of the small
tenants, who are waiting for their cases to be decided on in the
Land Courts, being evicted, before their cases come on, for
non-payment of excessive rents.  If nothing be done in this matter,
and if he be allowed to have his tenant right Association, this he
says will be his great difficulty next winter.  He wishes
Mr. Gladstone to observe that Davitt has not made any speeches in
Ireland, and he says that he obtained this pledge from him in
order to show the result of conciliation.  He disagrees entirely
with Davitt's "nationalisation" of land scheme, and says that
the Irish tenants do not themselves desire it.
</p>

<p class="quote">
He again suggests whether it would not be possible to insert
limitations in the Intimidation Clause?  And he would suggest
that, if possible, it would be desirable to leave the clause as it
stands, without any definition section, and to say that, as there
is no desire to prevent an orderly and legal tenant right Association,
additions will be made to the clause on Report, defining
all this.
</p>

<p class="quote">
As regards the tribunal, he hopes that Mr. Gladstone will
agree to a proviso, making the Court consist of a magistrate
and a barrister.  This he thinks will render it more easy to accept
the intimidation clause with the limitations that he suggests, for
many of the resident magistrates are half-pay captains, who have
been appointed by interest, and who are hand in glove with the
landlords, and some of them are certain to act foolishly.
</p>

<p class="quote">
If this be accepted, if unlawful associations are made there
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P184"></a>184}</span>
which the Lord Lieutenant declares to be unlawful; if it be made
a crime to not attend an unlawful assembly, but to riot at, or to
refuse to retire if called upon to do so from an unlawful assembly,
I do not think that he attaches very great importance to the
duration of the Act, although he still says that he does, but he
would be satisfied if the duration of the Act were for three years
with the proviso that the Lord Lieutenant has to prolong it (if it
is prolonged) by a proclamation at the end of each year.  He is
anxious for this, because he thinks that he could do much for the
cause of law and order, if he were able to point out that possibly
the Act would not run for the whole three years, if the Irish are
quiet and peaceable.
</p>

<p class="quote">
His main anxiety at the present moment seems to be, that
Mr. Gladstone should understand the position of the Land League
and of its leaders.  He wishes most sincerely to fight with the
Government against all outrages, and he complains that his good
intentions are met every moment by a <i>non possumus</i> of lawyers,
who seem to regard it as a matter of <i>amour propre</i> not to listen
to him, and he says (and I am sure he believes it) that the result
will be murders and outrages which will end in martial
law.&mdash;Yours truly, H. LABOUCHERE.
</p>

<p class="quote">
P.S.&mdash;With regard to supply, he says that he thinks it a
little hard, that he should be asked not to obstruct one Bill,
because the Conservatives will obstruct another, and he suggests
that Supply might be taken before the Report on the Bill now
under discussion, with some sort of understanding that the Irish
would not put down notices on going into Committee of Supply.
But on this matter, he says that he is certain that if Mr. Gladstone
will fairly look into his suggestions, he will see their force,
and he still hopes that all obstruction, etc., etc., may be avoided.

10 QUEEN ANNE'S GATE, June 10, 1882.
</p>

<p class="quote">
DEAR CHAMBERLAIN,&mdash;As it seems to be understood that
Harcourt had stated in the House his readiness to accept the
amendment which I gave you yesterday, Healy has put it down.
</p>

<p class="quote">
As regards "unlawful," which was negatived last night, I
explained to Healy that it was impossible to make the limitation
on account of legal and technical difficulties, and he fully accepted
this explanation.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P185"></a>185}</span>
</p>

<p class="quote">
With regard to the two limitations which stand in Parnell's
name, and which they ask for, I told Healy that the wording
of the limitations could not be used, as it would have a bad effect
to say in an Act that the non-payment of rent is not an offence.
To this he assented, and is quite ready to accept any words,
taken from the Act of '75 or from anywhere else, which will
cover the limitations.  Would it not be as well to have the
words ready, and to let Parnell have them, or at least to be
ready with the substituted words when Parnell's amendment
comes on?
</p>

<p class="quote">
There is a clause about exclusive dealing.  When the suggestions
which I submitted to you were being discussed by Parnell
and Healy, they were very anxious to include Davy's amendment
in regard to exclusive dealing, substituting for "dealing
with"&mdash;"buying," by which they would have excluded a refusal
to buy from Boycotting.  I got them to say that this was not to
be pressed if Government declined to accept the amendment, so
I did not trouble you with it.  Late last evening Parnell wanted
to insist on it, so I appealed to Healy.  He said that they were
bound not to insist on more than had been submitted to you, as
this would not be honourable, and therefore all trouble on this
head is avoided.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Of course they will in the House divide on some amendment
in regard to exclusive dealing, as a protest, and they may make
one or two speeches, but there will be no obstruction, and I see
no reason why the Bill should not be through Committee
(notwithstanding Goschen's gloomy prognostications) in a few days.
</p>

<p class="quote">
It would, I think, very much tend to aid matters if Harcourt
could in the course of discussion state, that in all cases a barrister
will sit with a residential magistrate.  He has already said that
there will be an appeal to Quarter Sessions, which in Ireland
means an appeal to the County Court Judge.  But some of the
residential magistrates are very foolish persons, and all are
regarded as men in the landlords' camp.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Also, is it not possible to arrive at some clear definition as to
what is an unlawful association?  Parnell says that it is left now
to any residential magistrate to decide the matter.  He suggests
that only such associations shall be unlawful, for the purpose of
the Act, which are proclaimed as such by the Lord Lieutenant.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P186"></a>186}</span>
But provided that there be a clear definition, he does not care
for any particular wording.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Parnell and Healy request me to say that they are very grateful
to Mr. Gladstone for meeting them half-way, and they seem
only now anxious about "treason felony."  As Herschell told me
that he thinks everything necessary will be covered by the
word "treason," I hope that this matter will also be settled
satisfactorily.&mdash;Yours truly,
</p>

<p class="quote">
H. LABOUCHERE.
</p>

<p class="quote">
P.S.&mdash;Parnell would not like any one but you and Mr. Gladstone
to know about his dispute with Egan, and the embargo
on the League funds, except in a very general way.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
10 QUEEN ANNE'S GATE, June 24, 1882.
</p>

<p class="quote">
DEAR CHAMBERLAIN,&mdash;I saw Parnell, and spoke to him as you
wished.
</p>

<p class="quote">
His answer is practically this:
</p>

<p class="quote">
"I acknowledge that Mr. Gladstone and Mr. Chamberlain
have acted fairly, and so far as I can I should always be ready to
meet their wishes.  But I deny that we have obtained the
concessions that we expected.  I am not prepared to go back to
Ireland and engage in bringing the agitation within constitutional
limits, on the mere chance of Lord Spencer not arresting me.
The Fenians want one thing: the Ladies' League another: the
people in Paris (Egan) another: and I another.  Therefore I
shall limit my action to Parliament and leave the Government
and the Fenians to fight it out in Ireland.  The Cabinet do not
seem to realise that the Crimes Bill is a very complex one, and
very loosely drawn up.  There has been no obstruction in the
proper sense of the word, although I admit that the Irish have
repeated again and again the same arguments on amendments.
But this I cannot help, unless I tell them that they will get
something by holding their tongues.  When the Conservatives
threatened obstruction on Procedure, this was met by telling them that
the majority resolution would not be pressed if they would
facilitate business.  Why should not the same arrangement be
made with us?  Let us know what amendments will be accepted
in future.  I am most anxious to carry out what I understood
was the contemplated policy when I was released from
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P187"></a>187}</span>
Kilmainham, and to work with the Government in bringing the active
phase of Irish agitation to a close.  But this I cannot do if I am
suspected of ulterior objects, and if I cannot show that something
is gained for my party."
</p>

<p class="quote">
He then suggested that if the Government would take their
November Session for alterations in the Land Act, he would do
his best to facilitate business now in regard to the Crimes, and
the Arrears Bill, and the Procedure Resolutions, provided that
the majority Resolution were maintained.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I asked him what he really wanted under the term of alterations
in the Land Act?
</p>

<p class="quote">
He said: "To go back to the system of reductions in rent
which was acted on before the Stuart Donleathcase, and to extend
the Bright clauses in the sense of W. H. Smith's resolution."
</p>

<p class="quote">
Finally, I again urged him to remember what Mr. Gladstone
and you had done for him already, and to see whether he could
not manage to bring the Committee Stage of the Bill to an end
within a reasonable time.
</p>

<p class="quote">
On Monday, Sexton proposes to cut Chaplin out by bringing
forward a resolution about the suspects.  Parnell says that this
is absolutely necessary, because he and his friends are blamed for
only caring for their own release.  But Sexton will say that he
only does this, because it is a choice between his resolution and
Chaplin's, and there will be no talking to hinder the Government
from getting their money, or with the object of obstructing.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I have got to go to Northampton on Monday, so I shall not
be in the House until late.&mdash;Yours truly,
</p>

<p class="quote">
H. LABOUCHERE.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
When the Crimes Act was finally passed, Mr. Labouchere
expressed himself in <i>Truth</i> as follows:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
When Mr. Parnell was released from Kilmainham, it was
understood that the Land Act would be amended, that evictions
would be stopped by an Arrears Bill, and that the leaders of the
land movement would be permitted to agitate within fair legal
limits in favour of the political and social changes desired by their
countrymen.  Had this understanding been carried out, the breach
between the Parnellites and the Liberals would have been healed.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P188"></a>188}</span>
</p>

<p class="quote">
Mr. Forster was the first to perceive that as a result of a <i>modus
vivendi</i> he would have to disappear with his policy of coercion.  He
therefore resigned, in the hope that this would render it impossible
to carry out the Kilmainham compact.  Then followed the
murder of Lord Frederick Cavendish.  The horror which this
created was skilfully used by the Whigs in the Cabinet, and they
succeeded in promoting a Bill, not so much aimed at outrages as
at the Kilmainham compact.  This Bill is a complete codification
of arbitrary rule.  It places the lives, liberties, and property
of the Irish in the hands of the Executive, and seeks to suppress
every species of political agitation.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Unfortunately, Mr. Trevelyan was awaiting his re-election
when it was introduced, and it was left to Sir William Harcourt
to carry it through the House of Commons.  Of course, as Sir
William is the head-centre of the Whigs, he delighted in his task.
Not only did he refuse every modification of the Bill, except
those which were rendered absolutely necessary by the absurd
way in which it was drawn, but almost every day he envenomed
discussion by transpontine outbursts against the Irish members.
I do not blame him.  I blame no one who plays his cards to his
own best advantage.  This is human nature.  Sir William knew
that if the English Radicals and the Irish were allied, he and his
Whigs would lose all influence, whilst of Ireland he knew
absolutely nothing.
</p>

<p class="quote">
The result, therefore, has been that the Whigs triumph, and
that several weeks have been wasted in passing a Bill which will
do nothing to hinder outrages, but which will simply increase
the ill-feeling between England and Ireland.
</p>

<p class="quote">
If the leaders of the land movement are wise, they will not
endeavour to hold meetings.  They should declare that public
meeting has been rendered impossible by the Crimes Act; and
they should, as an act of charity, collect funds to aid all who
have been evicted, no matter from what cause, and thus band
the Irish tenants together in a friendly society.  At the same time,
they should devote all their energies to increase their numbers in
the next Parliament, and they should submit test questions to
every Liberal standing for an English constituency where there
are Irish voters, and make these votes dependent upon the
manner in which the questions are answered.  If Mr. Parnell can
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P189"></a>189}</span>
hold the balance in Parliament between the rival aspirants for
the Treasury Bench, he may be certain that any just demand
that he may make will be granted.  The democracy of England
and Ireland, with Mr. Gladstone at their head, would make short
work of Conservative and Whig obstructive trash.  The landlords
in Ireland and the Whigs in England stand in the way of
peace and tranquillity in the former island, and of mutual good
feeling in both.[<a id="chap08fn8text"></a><a href="#chap08fn8">8</a>]
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
To quote Mr. Labouchere's views on Ireland during the
dark and gloomy period which followed the introduction of
the Prevention of Crimes Bill is to quote Mr. Chamberlain's,
for, as is seen by their constant correspondence, the two
were one in their views on Irish discontent.  Mr. Chamberlain
made a speech at Swansea in February, 1883, in which
he asked his audience how long they supposed Englishmen
with their free institutions would tolerate the existence of
an Irish Poland so near to their own shores.  Was separation
the only alternative?  He thought not.  Separation,
in his opinion, would "jeopardise the security of this country,
and would be fatal to the prosperity and happiness of
Ireland."  He, like Labouchere, was prepared to relax the bond,
even by conceding what was then known as Home Rule,
which would not include an independent Parliament or a
separate executive.[<a id="chap08fn9text"></a><a href="#chap08fn9">9</a>]
</p>

<p>
However, in 1883 and 1884, Englishmen had other things
to occupy their minds than the rights and wrongs of Ireland.
In order to follow the political career of Mr. Labouchere
we must for a time leave the Irish question and consider
"the policy of Gladstone's Government in Egypt."

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
<br><br>
LABOUCHERE AND MR. GLADSTONE'S EGYPTIAN POLICY
</h3>

<p>
Lord Morley has commented on the irony of fate
which imposed on Mr. Gladstone the unwelcome task
of Egyptian occupation.  "It was one of the ironies," he
says, "in which every active statesman's life abounds."  Disparity
between intentions and achievements is indeed
inevitable in all departments of activity, but nowhere more
so than in cases of what may be called creative policy.
Destruction is easy.  But a constructive policy which shall
bring about a new and more favourable state of things, and
may, therefore, in this sense be called creative, is strangely
apt either to overshoot its mark or to deviate into
unexpected channels, with results wholly unlooked for by the
statesman responsible for its conduct.
</p>

<p>
Certainly this ironic force of circumstances was
peculiarly apparent in the case of Mr. Gladstone's Egyptian
policy.  The problem of Egypt was not of his seeking, but
was a legacy from the Tories.  In 1875 Disraeli, against
the advice of Lord Derby, his Foreign Minister, and without
consulting the other members of his Cabinet, arranged with
the London Rothschilds to purchase Khedive Ismail's
shares in the Suez Canal for four millions sterling.  Ismail,
whose absolute reign of eighteen years had cost Egypt[<a id="chap09fn1text"></a><a href="#chap09fn1">1</a>] no
less a sum than four hundred millions sterling, had been
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P191"></a>191}</span>
driven by his preposterous extravagance, and the consequent
exhaustion of both his legitimate and illegitimate methods
of procuring revenue, to look abroad for financial assistance.
France, besides being crippled by the war of 1870, was
regarded with suspicion in the matter of the canal, and the
only alternative to France was England.  A trifle like four
millions was very far from what Ismail really required to
give any sort of financial stability to his government, and,
after the loan with Rothschild had been negotiated, the
British Cabinet sent out a series of commissioners to study
the state of affairs on the spot, and to see what could be done
in the interests of Egyptian rule and, incidentally, of the
foreign bondholders.  Eventually a settlement of Ismail's
affairs, known as the Goschen-Joubert arrangement, was
made, by which the enormous yearly payment of nearly
seven millions sterling was charged on the Egyptian revenue.
Greek usurers attended the tax-gatherers on their rounds,
and the ruined fellaheen were forced to mortgage their lands
to meet these amazing demands.  Even such methods failed
of success owing to the famine of the two preceding years.
The obviously juster course was now to let Ismail become
bankrupt and abandon the Goschen-Joubert arrangement,
but the foreign bondholders were naturally opposed to this,
and pointed out reasonably enough that the English Government
had guaranteed the loan.  The moment was favourable
to their views.  Dizzy had succeeded in converting his
colleagues, with the exception of Derby, who retired and was
succeeded by Lord Salisbury as Foreign Secretary, to his
neo-Imperialism in which an Asiatic Empire under British
rule was an element.  About this time, too, the secret
convention relating to the lease of Cyprus was signed with the
Porte.  When, a month later, the Berlin Congress was
called together, such was the suspicion with which the
plenipotentiaries regarded each other that each ambassador was
obliged, before entering the Congress, to affirm that he
was not bound by any secret engagement with the Porte.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P192"></a>192}</span>
Disraeli and Salisbury both gave the required declaration.
"It must be remembered," says Mr. Blunt indulgently,
"that both were new to diplomacy."  A few weeks later
the <i>Globe</i> published the text of the Cyprus Convention,
bought by that journal from one Marvin, an Oriental scholar,
who had been imprudently employed as translator of the
Turkish text.  In London the authenticity of the document
was denied, but the truth had to come out at Berlin.  The
discovery almost broke up the Congress.  Prince
Gortschakoff, the Russian representative, and M. Waddington,
the Ambassador of France, both announced that they would
withdraw at once from the sittings, and Waddington literally
packed his trunks.  It needed the cynical good offices of
Bismarck to reconcile the English and the French
plenipotentiaries.[<a id="chap09fn2text"></a><a href="#chap09fn2">2</a>]  There were two very significant points on
which agreement was reached:
</p>

<p>
1. "That as a compensation to France for England's
acquisition of Cyprus, France should be allowed on the
first convenient opportunity, and without opposition from
England, to occupy Tunis."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P193"></a>193}</span>
</p>

<p>
2. "That in the financial arrangements being made in
Egypt, France should march <i>pari passu</i> with England."
</p>

<p>
This was the source of the Anglo-French condominium
in Egypt.
</p>

<p>
Sir Rivers Wilson, who was then acting in Egypt as
English Commissioner, received instructions to see that
France should be equally represented with England in all
financial appointments made in connection with his inquiry.
Wilson's appointment as English Commissioner on the
nominally International Commission of Inquiry was almost
the first signed by Lord Salisbury on taking over the Foreign
Office from Lord Derby.  He was a man from whom much
was expected.  In 1878 he was appointed Finance Minister
in Egypt.  His predecessor, Ismail Sadyk, had been treacherously
murdered by the Khedive Ismail, but this fact did not
dash his confidence.  He had great faith in Nubar, Ismail's
Prime Minister.  His French education would, he thought,
enable him to preserve the Anglo-French character of the
Ministry.  He also had behind him the full interest and
power of the house of Rothschild, whom he had persuaded
to advance the loan of nine millions, known as the Kedival
Domains Loan.  But his brief career as Finance Minister
(the Nubar Ministry was overthrown in the February of
1879) was a failure.  It is the opinion of Mr. Blunt, and no
one would have been more likely to know the true state of
affairs, that the Khedive himself intrigued against him and
that the internal policy of the country was entirely in the
hands of Nubar, who, as a Christian, was at a disadvantage
in governing a Mohammedan country, and in whose political
value Wilson seems to have been greatly mistaken.  The
loan which he had negotiated did not relieve the taxpayer,
but went in paying the more immediately urgent calls.  His
suggestion of a scheme which would have involved the
confiscation by the Government of landed property to the
value of fifteen millions disturbed the minds of the
land-owners, and the mistakes of the Ministry reached their
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P194"></a>194}</span>
climax when the native army, including 2500 officers, was
disbanded without receiving their arrears of pay.
</p>

<p>
The fall of Nubar was brought about by the <i>émeute</i> of
February, 1879, skilfully engineered by the Khedive, and
Sir Rivers's position as Finance Minister became very
difficult.  The Consul-General Vivian (afterwards Lord
Vivian) was a personal enemy of his and refrained from
smoothing his path, and when, in March, the crafty Ismail
arranged a little incident at Alexandria similar to that of
February, the Foreign Office, instead of backing his demand
for redress, advised him to resign, which he accordingly did.
Soon, however, he was able to take a crushing revenge on the
perfidious Ismail.  On his return from Egypt he went straight
to the Rothschilds and explained to them that their money
was in great danger, as the Khedive intended to repudiate
the debt, sheltering himself behind the excuse of constitutional
government.  The Rothschilds brought financial pressure
to bear first on Downing Street and the Quai d'Orsay.
Their efforts in these quarters being in vain, they applied
to Bismarck, who was, perhaps, not sorry to have an
excuse to state the intention of the German Government to
intervene in the bondholders' interests in case the French
and English Governments were unable to do so.  German
intervention would have been a quite unendurable solution,
and the Sultan was at once approached from London and
Paris and begged to depose his vassal.  European pressure
was too much for him, and, in spite of the many millions
which he had paid in bribery to the Porte, Ismail received
a curt notice from Sir Frank Lascelles, then acting English
diplomatic agent in Egypt, that a telegram had reached
him from the Sultan announcing that his viceregal duties
had passed to his son Tewfik.  Ismail cleared the treasury
of its current account and retired with a final spoil of some
three millions sterling.  No one hindered his departure.
</p>

<p>
For a few months after Mr. Gladstone formed his second
administration things seemed to have quieted down in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P195"></a>195}</span>
Egypt.  The new Khedive was a weak character and the
country was practically governed by French and English
Ministers in the Cabinet.  Sir Evelyn Baring (afterwards
Lord Cromer) and M. de Blaquières worked together in
perfect harmony.  Sir Evelyn Baring had originally come
to Egypt as Commissioner of the Debt, and had worked so
successfully towards a new settlement that when the
question of the appointment of an English controller to advise
the Khedive's Ministers arose, he was the person naturally
indicated for the post.  "Thus," as he says, "the various
essential parts of the State machine were adjusted.  A
new Khedive ruled.  The relations between the Khedive
and his Ministers were placed on a satisfactory footing.  A
Prime Minister (Riaz Pasha) had been nominated who had
taken an active part in opposing the abuses prevalent
during the reign of Ismail Pasha.  The relations between the
Sultan and the Khedive had been regulated in such a way
as to ensure the latter against any excessive degree of Turkish
interference.  The system which had been devised for
associating Europeans with the Government held out good
promise of success, inasmuch as it was in accordance with
the Khedive's own views.  Lastly, an International Commission
had been created with full powers to arrange matters
between the Egyptian Government and their creditors."[<a id="chap09fn3text"></a><a href="#chap09fn3">3</a>]  But,
suddenly, as it seemed to those who had not been
watching events on the spot, across this peaceful sky flashed
the red meteor of rebellion, massacre, and arson.
</p>

<p>
It is no easy matter to estimate the character of Arabi
Pasha.  He seems, from even so friendly an account as that
of Mr. Wilfrid Blunt, not to have been particularly intelligent
or particularly brave.  It appears likely that he, at least,
connived at the burning and loot of Alexandria.  All this,
however, would not have prevented his being a true patriot
according to his lights.  As Mr. Herbert Paul observes:
"How far Arabi was a mutinous soldier guided by personal
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P196"></a>196}</span>
ambition and how far he was an enthusiastic patriot burning
to free his country from a foreign yoke, would admit of an
easier answer if one alternative excluded the other."[<a id="chap09fn4text"></a><a href="#chap09fn4">4</a>]  One
thing, however, is certain.  The movement he led was far
more than the merely military revolt which Mr. Gladstone
and everyone in England at first thought it; it was in fact
a genuine Nationalist movement directed rather against
the alien Turk than against the alien Englishman.  That
the truth of this is now generally admitted is principally due
to Mr. Blunt and in a lesser degree to Mr. Labouchere and
the group of extreme Radicals of which he was already
beginning to be the unofficial leader in Parliament.  During
the spring and summer of 1882, Mr. Labouchere's first
observations in the House of Commons on Egyptian affairs
were of a thoroughly orthodox nature.  On May 12 we
find him asking the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs (Sir
Charles Dilke) "whether any steps are being taken by Her
Majesty's Government in view of the critical state of affairs
in Egypt to maintain our influence in that country."[<a id="chap09fn5text"></a><a href="#chap09fn5">5</a>]  On
July 27 he replies in a vein at once serious and sarcastic to
Mr. McCarthy, who had made a speech in Arabi's favour.
He thought that Mr. McCarthy had drawn on his imagination
for the character of Arabi Pasha.  They knew perfectly
well that the most eminent men in the world were frequently
great patriots; and they also knew that military adventurers
always called themselves patriots in order to advance their
own ends.  They knew little of the career of Arabi Pasha,
but they did know that he had designedly massacred
Europeans in Alexandria, and had deliberately burnt down one
of the noblest cities of his native land.  What would be the
effect of the vote[<a id="chap09fn6text"></a><a href="#chap09fn6">6</a>] they proposed to give if it were successful?
The English nation would have to withdraw entirely from
their present position in Egypt, and the result would be that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P197"></a>197}</span>
we should have behaved in a contemptible manner in the
face of Europe.  India would not be worth one year's
purchase.  He was not a great believer in prestige; but if we
were to retire after our men had been massacred our Empire
in the East would not be worth a year's purchase.  This
speech, occupying eight columns of <i>Hansard</i>, aims at cutting
away the relations between England and Turkey (which
shows that even at so early a date Mr. Labouchere realised
something of the true nature of the grievance of the Egyptian
Nationalists) and upholding British intervention.[<a id="chap09fn7text"></a><a href="#chap09fn7">7</a>]  Labby
among the prophets indeed!
</p>

<p>
After the retirement of Arabi from Alexandria, he issued
a proclamation stating that "irreconcilable war existed
between the Egyptians and the English, and all those who
proved traitors to their country would not only be subjected
to the severest penalty in accordance with martial law, but
would be for ever accursed in the next world."  Three more
towns were plundered and the European inhabitants massacred.
British public opinion was now thoroughly aroused,
and probably no Government could have stayed in power
without taking some overt action.  The action taken by
Mr. Gladstone's Government was very definite.  On July
22 the Prime Minister obtained, by a majority of 275 to 19,
a vote of £2,300,000.  A force of 6000 men was sent to Egypt
from India; 15,000 men were despatched to Cyprus and
Malta.  Sir Garnet (afterwards Viscount) Wolseley was
placed in command in Egypt, "in support of the authority
of His Highness the Khedive, as established by the Firmans
of the Sultan and the existing international engagements, to
suppress a military revolt in that country."
</p>

<p>
The French Government, while declining to co-operate
with the British troops, assured Lord Granville of their moral
support.  In the month of September the battle of Tel-el-Kebir,
in which the Egyptian army was completely routed,
was fought.  By this event British intervention was justified
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P198"></a>198}</span>
in the eyes of the world, and what became in the long run
hardly distinguishable from British rule was established on
the banks of the Nile.  It was the battle of Tel-el-Kebir that
convinced Mr. Labouchere of what would be, and in fact what
came to be, the end of the course on which the Government
was embarked, for he very soon sold his Egyptian shares.
"They fell off his back like Christian's burden in <i>Pilgrim's
Progress</i>, and Labby became an honest politician," said
Mr. Wilfrid Blunt to me.  The following letter to Sir Charles Dilke
very clearly expresses his new views on Egyptian policy:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
REFORM CLUB, October 10, 1882.
</p>

<p class="quote">
DEAR DILKE,&mdash;The great ones of the earth who, like you,
live in Government Offices, never really understand the bent of
public opinion.  This is probably a dispensation of Providence
by means of which Ministers are not eternal.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Personally, I should be glad to see the Liberal Party, after
passing a Franchise Bill, sent about their business, and the
country divided between Conservatives and Radicals.  I speak,
therefore, from the Radical standpoint, and viewing the matter
from that point, I see that the dissatisfaction against your
Egyptian policy is growing.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Arabi (like most patriots) was "on the make."  His force
consisted in siding with the Notables in their legitimate demands.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Now that the war is over, it is really impossible for Radicals
to accept a policy based upon administering Egypt, partly for
the good of its inhabitants, but mainly for the good of the
bond-holders.  I am a bondholder, so it cannot be said that I am
personally prejudiced against such a policy.  But I am sure that it
will not go down, and indeed that our whole course of action has
been so tainted with it, that there will be great disaffection in
the Radical ranks throughout the country unless the tree be now
made to bend the other way.
</p>

<p class="quote">
You are now the man in possession in Egypt, so you can make
terms with Europe.  I would therefore humbly suggest that you
should, after insisting upon an amnesty, call together the Notables
and hand the country over to them, stipulating alone that there
should be Ministerial responsibility, and the control of the purse.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P199"></a>199}</span>
The International Obligation of Egypt to pay its bondholders
was <i>bon à professer</i>, when the Expedition had to be defended,
but it is in reality a pure fiction.  Moreover, if it were not, we
cannot decently join in a holy alliance to maintain Khedives,
and to deprive nations of what is the very basis of representative
government.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Having handed Egypt over to the Notables, you can then
go before Europe with a clean bill of health&mdash;propose that the
connection of the country with Turkey shall be a purely nominal
one and that, henceforward, no European power shall directly
or indirectly interfere with its internal affairs.
</p>

<p class="quote">
At the same time, you ought to take advantage of your being
in Egypt to establish yourself in some vantage post on the Suez
Canal.  This once done, Egypt separated from Turkey, and all
European powers warned off, we remain in reality absolute
masters of the position.  Very probably the Egyptians will
make a muddle of these finances, but this will no more affect
us than the mistakes of Spanish finances affect our tenure of
Gibraltar.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Controllers, a swarm of foreign bureaucrats, European
administrators, Khedives ruling against the wishes of their subjects,
an English army of occupation or an army commanded by my
esteemed friend, Baker, composed of black ex-slaves, Ottoman
cut-throats, and Swiss cowboys, are abominations, only equal
to that of concerning ourselves with the payment of interest on
a public debt.  To attempt these things will be to keep open a
perpetual Radical sore, and in the end will only land us in another
expedition.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Pray excuse the observations of a humble admirer.  The
Jingoes, it is true, are not so hostile as they were, but you do not
suppose that they would vote for the present Government, whilst
on the other hand the Radicals will sulk and not vote so long as
Radical principles are ignored in Egypt.  Government has not
yet announced its policy, so at present no great harm is done,
but the appointment of Baker, the handing over of Arabi to the
Khedive, the reign of Generals and diplomatists, the absence of
any appearance of consulting the Egyptians, and various other
similar things are producing distrust.  You will say, "What
can a fellah know of politics?"  To this I can only answer,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P200"></a>200}</span>
"What does a Wiltshire peasant know about them?"&mdash;Yours
truly,

<p class="quote">
H. LABOUCHERE.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Mr. Labouchere soon began to put forward his reformed
views in Parliament.  On October 30 we find him asking
Sir Charles Dilke whether "Her Majesty's Government is
a party to any treaty, alliance, or compact with any foreign
power which would oblige it to prevent the Egyptians from
exercising that control over their taxation, expenditure, and
administration which is enjoyed by the inhabitants of the
independent or semi-independent States which formerly
were integral parts of the Ottoman Empire,"[<a id="chap09fn8text"></a><a href="#chap09fn8">8</a>] and demanding
information as to the cruelty and insults to which it was
alleged the Egyptian prisoners had been subjected.
Mr. Labouchere wrote a long article in <i>Truth</i> under the heading:
"Egypt was glad when they departed" (Psalm cv., 38), the
following extracts from which put the situation very clearly
as he conceived it.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
"That a small body of English troops should remain for a brief
time in Egypt at the expense of that country is, perhaps, a
necessity of the position.  But what I contend is, that during their
stay the Notables ought to be called together, that every place
of emolument ought to be filled up by an Egyptian, that the bag
and baggage policy ought to be adopted towards the Turkish
officials, who are as objectionable to the natives as were the
Turkish officials to the Bulgarians, and that a free constitutional
government ought to be established, based on the two corner
stones of all constitutional liberty&mdash;Ministerial responsibility
and the right of taxpayers over the purse.  In order to carry out
this programme&mdash;distasteful alike to professional diplomatists
and to professional soldiers&mdash;we ought at once to send to Egypt
a stalwart and experienced Liberal, who has graduated in the
school of Parliamentary Government, and not in those of the
Horse Guards, of the Foreign Office, or of the India Office.
Looking round, I see no man better able to fill the post than Mr. Shaw
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P201"></a>201}</span>
Lefevre.  He is able, he is a skilled and successful administrator,
he is untainted with the creed that all Orientals are made to be
bondsmen for Europeans, and his political principles are
exceptionally sound.
</p>

<p class="quote">
What our diplomacy has to do is, to discover some means to
render the high road to India through the Canal secure.
Obviously we cannot do in this matter precisely as we should like,
which would be to say that in time of peace all war vessels may
pass through the Canal, and in time of war only ours.  I hardly
see how we can go beyond making the passage neutral in times
of peace, and excluding from it in times of war the ships of
belligerents.  If Egypt were left to herself, I believe that she could
very safely be left in charge of the Canal.  Her people would be
glad to be clear of all European complications, and, in case of
war, she would occupy Port Said, and notify belligerents that
their ships would not be allowed to pass."

On the question of India he expressed himself thus:

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
I am not at all of the "Perish India" school of politics.  If
it could be proved that our Empire would perish if we did not
establish ourselves in Egypt, I am by no means certain but what
I should be in favour of our establishment.  But I am a believer
not only in the justice, but in the expediency of an alliance with
the people of a country, and not with its ruler against the people.
Any intermixture in the internal affairs of Egypt on our part is
not only opposed to Liberal principles, but opposed to English
interests.  To what has it already led?  To a most costly military
expedition; to our being arrayed against rights without which
there can be no true liberty or sound government; to the slaughter
of Englishmen and Egyptians with all the "pomp and pride of
glorious war"; and lastly to our soldiers acting as retrievers, to
hunt down and hand over to punishment to an Ottoman potentate,
men many of whom&mdash;whether they were ambitious and whether
they were ill-advised&mdash;had unquestionably a perfect right to
fight in support of the principle that the only authority of their
nation ought to be its representatives.[<a id="chap09fn9text"></a><a href="#chap09fn9">9</a>]
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P202"></a>202}</span>
</p>

<p>
A correspondent at once asked him: "How is it that you
were in favour of the control and in favour of the Expedition,
and yet now tell your readers that the control ought to
cease, and that having by means of the Expedition established
a firm foothold in Egypt, our next step ought to be
to evacuate the country?"  The following number of <i>Truth</i>
delivered itself in reply as follows:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
The Control, when first established, simply meant that
Egypt should go into liquidation, and pay so much in the pound
to its creditors, a couple of European controllers with half a
dozen clerks, being appointed by the Egyptian Government to
receive the composition from the Egyptian Treasury, and to
hand it over to the various classes of bondholders.  To this there
could have been no sort of objection; but, little by little, this
simple and semi-private arrangement was converted into a so-called
international obligation on the part of the Egyptians to remain
eternally divested from all control over their own expenditure,
and to allow their entire financial administration to be placed in
the hands of about 1300 Europeans, with salaries amounting to
nearly £400,000 per annum, whilst the Controllers themselves
had seats in the Cabinet, with a veto upon everything proposed
by their Egyptian colleagues.  France and England were the
executive officers of this scheme.  If the Egyptian officers had
assented to it, nothing further was to be said, except that they
were singularly and curiously wanting in patriotism.  However
we find now that they did not, and that we have been under an
illusion.  The Notables and the entire country were&mdash;to their
credit be it said&mdash;opposed to it.  Arabi took advantage of this
feeling.  He sided with the country, and at the same time made
his bargain.  "I," he practically said to the Notables, "support
you in your rights; as a <i>quid pro quo</i> you must support me in
what I am pleased to call the rights of the army&mdash;that is to say,
that it shall be increased by 18,000 men."  Without the army
the Notables were powerless; they accordingly accepted the
terms.  We therefore find ourselves in the position that we were
fully justified in asserting that Arabi was a self-seeking military
adventurer, but that he was also the exponent of the legitimate
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P203"></a>203}</span>
demands of the Egyptian people.  The Control had become
political&mdash;it was no longer a reasonable financial arrangement, but
an unreasonable and improper attempt to deprive the Egyptians
of their rights, in order to secure high salaries for a swarm of
European locusts, and certainty of interest to European
bond-holders.  Those, therefore, who had regarded it in its natural
original conception, as fair and useful, have a perfect right to
assert that this original conception had been so perverted that
it had become a monstrous instrument for the suppression of all
national vitality.
</p>

<p class="quote">
We, however, were tied to France.  If we had not interfered,
France probably would have done so.  Moreover, we foolishly
had pledged ourselves to maintain the Khedive in his position.
The only way, therefore, to get out of the complication was to
cut the Gordian knot; but, in order to do this, we were necessarily
obliged to adopt the theory that Arabi was a mere military
adventurer, who was attempting for his own ends to coerce not
only the Khedive but the Egyptian people.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Our expedition, as was to be anticipated, has proved successful.
Our troops hold Egypt.  What then ought we to do?
Obviously to hand it over to the Notables, who are the
representatives of the Egyptian people, and to inform these Notables
that we have no intention of repeating our previous error, but
that, experience having shown us the fatal results of allowing
ourselves little by little to be dragged into an attempt to manage
other people's finances with a view to public creditors being paid
interest, we shall leave Egypt and Egypt's creditors to settle
their conflicting interests as they best please.  This is the logical
consequence of our having acted upon the assumption that Arabi
was terrorising the Egyptians....
</p>

<p class="quote">
It is evident to me, therefore, that the only policy which an
English Liberal Ministry can adopt is to go before Europe with
a proposal to make Egypt an Eastern Belgium, and to base our
suggestion upon our own renunciation of interference in its
internal affairs.  I hear it said that the Liberal party is popular
owing to its successes in Egypt.  It may, perhaps, be for the
nonce popular&mdash;or, to put it more correctly, not quite so
unpopular&mdash;as it was with Jingoes, but these same Jingoes will not
cease to vote for Conservatives....
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P204"></a>204}</span>
</p>

<p class="quote">
How then about the Canal?  Well, I should base my policy
upon that pursued in like cases by the United States.  I should
explain to Europe that the Canal is the connecting link between
Great Britain and India, and that consequently the exigencies
of geography and an enlightened self-interest render it absolutely
necessary for us to be paramount there.  There might be a little
grumbling, but no one would go to war to hinder this, because
its plain common-sense would be too obvious.[<a id="chap09fn10text"></a><a href="#chap09fn10">10</a>]
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
In the meantime Arabi was lying in prison at Cairo
awaiting his trial, and Mr. Labouchere took up his case
energetically in the House of Commons.  A military tribunal
was to be charged with the trial, and it was no secret
that the Khedive was determined that the death penalty
should be inflicted on the heads of the rebellion.
Mr. Wilfrid Blunt wrote, on September 1, a long letter to
Mr. Gladstone, stating his intention of providing Arabi with an
English counsel at his own expense and that of his friends,
and hoping that "every facility will be afforded me and
those with me in Egypt to prosecute our task."  Mr. Gladstone,
who was deeply hostile to Arabi, replied through his
secretary, that "all that he can say at the present moment
is that he will bring your request before Lord Granville,
with whom he will consult, but that he cannot hold out any
assurance that it will be complied with."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Labouchere continued to enquire into the Government's
intentions towards Arabi in the House of Commons.
A timely question on October 31 to Sir Charles Dilke secured
the intervention of the press at the trial, and further
questions on the following days forestalled the attempts of the
Khedive to wriggle out of the conditions that Mr. Blunt's
advocate had obtained from Mr. Gladstone.  Arabi was,
on December 4, condemned to death, and in spite of
Mr. Gladstone's being at first inclined to let the law take its
course, the sentence was commuted to banishment to Ceylon.
Mr. Labouchere commented in <i>Truth</i> as follows: "The farce
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P205"></a>205}</span>
of the rebel's condemnation to exile with retention of his
rank and with a handsome allowance, is a fitting conclusion
to the trial.  I see it stated that Arabi will be invited to take
up his residence in this or that portion of British territory.
It need hardly be said that he may reside in any part of the
world, outside Egypt, that he pleases.  There is no existing
law which enables us to detain an Egyptian in deference to the
wishes of an Egyptian Khedive; and it is not likely that we
shall ever consent to convert any portion of our territory into
an international gaol, where all who are in disfavour with foreign
rulers are to be deported, and restrained in their liberty."[<a id="chap09fn11text"></a><a href="#chap09fn11">11</a>]
</p>

<p>
When Parliament met after Christmas, Mr. Labouchere
seconded Sir Wilfrid Lawson's amendment to the Reply
to the Speech from the Throne to the effect that no sufficient
reason had been shown for the employment of British forces
in reconstituting the Government of Egypt.  It was certain,
he said, that Arabi was supported by the entire Egyptian
nation.  He could quite understand why the Opposition
did not challenge the policy of the Government.  The
Government were practically dragged into the war by the
acts of the Opposition when in power.  Anyone who read
the Blue Books must see that.  A great many Liberals and
all the Radicals in the country regretted the Government
plunging into the war.  There could be no doubt that it
was entered into for the sake of the bondholders and for
that reason only.  We were going to place the Egyptian
army under an English General and a financier at the side
of the Khedive, and then tell Europe that the Khedive was
an independent ruler and that we had nothing to do with
the Government of Egypt.  Why were we there?  For the
single object of collecting the debts of the bondholders.[<a id="chap09fn12text"></a><a href="#chap09fn12">12</a>]
</p>

<p>
He wrote to Mr. Chamberlain on January 9, 1883:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
You people do not seem to have a very clear policy in Egypt.
I cannot understand why you do not settle the French by adopting
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P206"></a>206}</span>
the line of "Egypt for the Egyptians" and convert the country
into a sort of Belgium.  If you can establish the principle
that no one is to interfere, you have got all that you want.
To do this only two things are necessary:
</p>

<p class="quote">
1. Fair Courts of Justice where "meum and tuum" is
recognised.
</p>

<p class="quote">
2. A Representative Assembly with a right to vote the
Budget.
</p>

<p class="quote">
As regards the debt there are three loans, secured by special
mortgages; two on land, and one on the railroads.  Let the
mortgagees take these securities, when the loans would be
converted into companies, and the interest on them not be dependent
upon any political arrangement.  Rothschild has always told
me that the domains, on which his loan of £400,000,000 is secured,
are worth £400,500,000.  By handing over to him the security,
£500,000 would therefore be obtained.
</p>

<p class="quote">
As regards the General Debt (the United), it is a swindle, but
without going into this it might be regarded as the general debt
of the country, and the Egyptians, like any other nation, would
be left to pay or not as they pleased.
</p>

<p class="quote">
The main swindle of the Goschen-Rivers-Wilson scheme was
that the fellahs had paid £17,000,000 to free the land from a
portion of the land tax after 1886.  The law which partially
liberated the land was abrogated, and, instead of the fellahs
being treated like bondholders, although they had paid cash,
whereas the latter had really paid about 20% on the value of the
bonds, they were told that as a <i>quid pro quo</i> they would receive
1% on their £17,000,000 for fifty years.  The Canal question
is nonsense.  If we hold the Red Sea we hold the Canal, in the
sense that we can stop all traffic.  If we are at war with a
maritime power, either we should have the command of the Mediterranean
or we should not.  In the latter case, we should still by
our hold on the Red Sea be able to close the Canal; in the former
case we should be able not only to close it to others, but to use
it for our own powers.  Protocols and treaties are waste paper,
they never hold against the exigencies of a belligerent; and, if
we were at war with one maritime power, we should not have
the others interfering to maintain our treaty rights, for, differing
on many things, all continental powers regard us as the bullies
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P207"></a>207}</span>
of the ocean.  An English garrison at Port Said is a reality; as
we are not likely to have one there, our best plan is to leave
things alone, and, in the event of a serious maritime war, at once
to occupy Port Said.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The interests of the Egyptian exiles also claimed
Mr. Labouchere's attention.  We find him in March putting
searching questions as to their precise legal status, demanding
satisfactory evidence of their support being adequately
provided for, and enquiring why the Egyptian Government
had unlawfully deprived Arabi of his title of Pasha.
</p>

<p>
In the debate of March 2 on a supplementary estimate
of £728,000 "for additional expenditure for army services
consequent on the dispatch of an expeditionary force to
Egypt," he spoke with his accustomed frankness.  He would
like to know where the money was to come from.  He had
seen it stated in the papers and other organs that it was to
be raised by an increase on the Income Tax.  For his part,
he should like to see it raised in one of two ways&mdash;one, by
raising it from the landed interest&mdash;or, since he was afraid
the Government would not accept that plan&mdash;in default,
by a general tax on every individual in the country poor or
rich.  Let every one of those shrieking Jingoes who went out
calling on the Government to go to war, now here and now
there, understand that they would have to pay for the cost
of those wars.  Then he thought they would be less inclined
than now to advance the Jingo policy which he was sorry to
see had been adopted by the Government, and which they
had inherited from gentlemen on the other side of the House.
He believed that the war had been a mistake all through.
If we went to Egypt at all we ought to have installed Arabi
instead of the Khedive.  He believed that as long as British
troops supported the Khedive and supported him against
his own subjects, England was absolutely responsible for
what was going on in Egypt.  No doubt Lord Dufferin did
his best to procure trustworthy information, but he was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P208"></a>208}</span>
necessarily very much in the hands of the Europeans and
of the Ministers and friends of the Khedive.  He did not
gather from the dispatches that Lord Dufferin had consulted
the people of Egypt.  Sir George Campbell, the member for
Kirkcaldy, said that he had read, marked, learned, and
inwardly digested Lord Dufferin's scheme of government.
For his own part, although he had read, marked, and learned
it to a certain degree he could not digest it because it was
objectionable to a Radical stomach.  Lord Dufferin's
scheme was a perfect sham of constitutional government.
If any species of representative government were established
in Egypt it must be based on control of the purse.  But
when anything was said to the noble Lord, the Under-secretary,
on this subject, he vaguely alluded to representative
government and international obligations.  Was Lord
Dufferin prevented from doing what he thought desirable
for the country by any obligations which the Egyptians were
supposed to be under to pay the interest on their debt?  If
there was any obligation on their part it was not our business
to go there to carry it out....  He denied that the people
of Egypt were bound by any such thing, but, supposing
they were, it was not England's business to deprive them of
the most elementary and necessary basis of representative
government&mdash;the government of the purse.[<a id="chap09fn13text"></a><a href="#chap09fn13">13</a>]
</p>

<p>
On June 11, he proposed the reduction of Lord Wolseley's
grant from £30,000 to £12,000.  What, he said, had Lord
Wolseley done in Egypt?  He went to Ismailia and from
thence marched his men to Cairo.  He took the straight
road, and on the road he found a lot of miserable Arabs
entrenched; he advanced and the Arabs marched away.
That was the whole history of the exploit in Egypt.[<a id="chap09fn14text"></a><a href="#chap09fn14">14</a>]
</p>

<p>
Lord Dufferin left Egypt in May, 1883, He was pleased
with the success of his mission.  To use his own words&mdash;"the
fellah like his own Memnon had not remained
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P209"></a>209}</span>
irresponsive to the beams of the new dawn."  He left Sir Edward
Malet as Consul-General, and resumed his normal functions
at Constantinople.  He departed under a shower of
compliments, and he left Egypt apparently prosperous.  Arabi
was an exile in Ceylon.  Sherif Pasha was the Khedive's
loyal and obedient Minister.  Sir Archibald Alison was
in command of the British garrison.  The Egyptian army,
about six thousand in number, was under the fostering care
of Sir Evelyn Wood.  Colonel Scott-Moncrieff directed the
work of irrigation, and another Briton, Sir Benson Maxwell,
superintended the native tribunals.  Hitherto the British
Government had made no mistakes, and Egypt had reaped
only benefit from the intrusion of the foreigner.  The false
position in which England stood with full authority, ample
power, and no legal right, had not yet led to any consequences
of a serious and practical kind.[<a id="chap09fn15text"></a><a href="#chap09fn15">15</a>]
</p>

<p>
Danger, was, however, creeping up to Egypt from the
south.  A vast, vaguely limited country, extending from
Assouan to the Equator, and known as the Soudan, had
been claimed as Egyptian territory by Ismail, who had
appointed the famous Gordon Governor-General.  On
Ismail's fall in '79, Gordon was recalled and the Soudan fell
a prey to local bandits.  The reconstituted Egyptian Government
was incapable of interference, and towards the end of
'82 a Mussulman, Mohamed Ahmed, raised the standard of
religious reform and rebellion against the distant and
incapable Egyptian authorities.  The Mahdi, or Messiah, as he
called himself, took El Obeid and made himself master of
Kordofan by the end of January, '83.  In the summer of
the same year seven thousand Egyptian troops, under the
command of Hicks Pasha, a retired officer of the Indian army,
who had entered the service of the Khedive, were dispatched
against him by the Egyptian Government.  Granville was
careful to formally disengage the responsibility of the English
Cabinet in this measure.  It is certain, however, that he
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P210"></a>210}</span>
could have prevented this action of the Khedive's Ministers,
and, as he was perfectly well aware through the information
of Colonel Stewart, who had been associated with Gordon's
administration, of the utter impossibility of Hicks's task, it
is difficult to acquit him of moral responsibility.  "The
faith in the power of phrases to alter facts," says Lord
Milner in his <i>England in Egypt</i>, "has never been more
strangely manifested than in this idea, that we could shake
off our virtual responsibility for the policy of Egypt in the
Soudan by a formal disclaimer."  On November 5, the
Egyptian force was cut to pieces near Shekan, about two
days' journey from El Obeid, by the Mahdi at the head of
forty thousand men, and Hicks and his staff died fighting
at hopeless odds.  On the advice of Sir Evelyn Baring, who
had just arrived in Egypt from India, where he had filled
the post of Financial Minister to Lord Ripon's Government,
the English Cabinet recognised at last their responsibility.
It was decided that the Soudan must be abandoned and
that the Mahdi must be induced to allow the Egyptian
garrisons, amounting to about forty thousand men, still
remaining there, to retire.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Labouchere wrote to Mr. Chamberlain as follows
on December 15, 1883: "I hope that we are not going to
undertake the reconquest of the Soudan.  The difficult
position in which we are comes from not having broken
entirely with the Conservative policy in Egypt.  <i>They</i>
might have annexed the country: we cannot, so we give
advice which is not taken, try to tinker up an impossible
financial situation, and make ourselves responsible for every
folly committed by a gang of corrupt and silly Pashas.  The
result is that we are now told that we have a new frontier
somewhere in the direction of the Equator, and that our
honour is concerned, etc., etc.  If the French are so foolish
as to wish to acquire influence in the Soudan, I cannot
conceive why we should seek to acquire it in order to prevent
them.  I believe that the Khedive and his friends are
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P211"></a>211}</span>
delighted at what has occurred, because they hope that our
evacuation will be put off; so long as we retain one soldier
there, or indeed assume the part of bailiffs for the locusts
who make money out of the country, something will always
occur to force us to remain."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Chamberlain replied on December 18: "I do not
think there is the slightest intention of engaging in any
operations in the Soudan.  The utmost we are likely to do
is to undertake the defence of Egypt proper, and I hope
there is no fear of that being attacked.  I wish we could get
out of the whole business, but I have always thought that,
at the time we interfered, we really had no possible
alternative.  I am not Christian enough to turn the other cheek
after one has been slapped, and we had unfortunately put
ourselves in a position in which the first slap had already
been administered.  It is, however, a warning and a lesson
to look a little more closely into the beginnings of things."
</p>

<p>
On the 20th Labouchere wrote again to Mr. Chamberlain:
"From all I hear, matters are in a mess in Egypt.
Tewfik is a weak creature, and he and his entourage intrigue
against us, and yet intrigue to keep us there, as they are afraid
of what may happen when we go.  If the fellahs have any
opinion, it is dislike of Tewfik as the puppet of 'foreigners.'  The
Mahdi will never attack Egypt proper, which is the
valley of the Nile and the Delta.  If we send more troops
there, it will be the more difficult to evacuate.  As long as
we retain a corporal's guard, it will be the object of Tewfik
and all the locusts to get up disturbances in order to
compromise us.  Surely it would be easy to come to an arrangement
by which Egypt would be neutralised and left to itself:
the reply always is that interest of the debt would not be
paid and that, in consequence of the Law of Liquidation,
some Power would interfere for the benefit of its Egyptian
bondholders.  But these worthy people must be comparatively
few in numbers, and except as a pretext, no Power
would think of taking up the cudgels for them, any more
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P212"></a>212}</span>
than they did for Peruvian bondholders.  The whole thing
is a mere bugbear.  Even if France did go there we should
not suffer."  To which Mr. Chamberlain replied on December
22: "I think I agree with you on all points of Egyptian
policy, but my hands are so full just now that I have to let
foreign affairs work themselves out, and to content myself
with occasionally giving a push in the right direction."
</p>

<p>
Public opinion in England was deeply stirred by the
disaster at Shekan, and one of those popular cries that are
so often and so disastrously interpreted as heavenly voices
went up all over the land.  The nation called for Gordon.
The question of Gordon's mission has been exhaustively
discussed from every point of view.  The responsibility for
his failure and tragic death is apportioned by Lord Cromer
between Gordon himself and the Government who overruled
his (Cromer's) objection to employing him, and went
on to make every mistake they could.  Gordon misinterpreted
his orders, and the Government was then made
responsible for the consequences of a policy of which they
had never dreamt.  He thus placed himself in a situation
from which it was impossible to extricate him in time.
Mr. Wilfrid Blunt, on the other hand, places the responsibility
of the tragedy principally at the door of Cromer.  I am
not here concerned with this delicate controversy.  Of this
at least there is no doubt, Gordon's mission was understood
by the country and Parliament to be of a purely peaceful
nature.  Its avowed object was one which approved itself
to Liberal ideas, <i>i.e.</i> the disengaging of British responsibility
from a purely Egyptian matter and the rescue of the
Egyptian garrisons.  Radicals understood that these purposes
were to be achieved by purely peaceful means.  The Mahdi
was presumably to be approached by recognised methods
of negotiation.  It is well known that when Gordon got to
Khartoum, these instructions went by the board.  He had
been nominated, while on his way, at Cairo, Governor-General
of the Soudan, and the Government left, by means
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P213"></a>213}</span>
of supplementary clauses in their instructions, a considerable
latitude to Baring under whose orders, at his (Baring's)
request, Gordon was placed.  Lord Cromer has told the
world in his <i>Modern Egypt</i> of the difficulties of the situation.
Gordon was a mystic and suffered chronically from
"inspirations," which changed a dozen times a day.  He does not
seem to have made any attempt to carry out his mission
by diplomatic methods.  He soon came to conceive of that
mission as a sort of rival "Mahdism."  He became the
Angel of the Lord fighting with Apollyon.  All this must
have been inexpressibly disconcerting to the prudent <i>homme
d'affaires</i> at Cairo, and no less so to his nominal superior in
Downing Street.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Labouchere's attitude in the matter was simple and
consistent.  On February 14, four days before Gordon
started, the Opposition moved a vote of censure on the
Government in consequence of the Hicks disaster, and were
supported by several Radical members.  Sir Wilfrid Lawson
was supported by Mr. Labouchere in an amendment to Sir
Stafford Northcote's motion: "That this House, whilst
declining at present to express an opinion on the Egyptian
policy which Her Majesty's Government have pursued
during the last two years with the support of the House,
trusts that in future British forces may not be employed
for the purpose of interfering with the Egyptian people in
their selection of their own Government."[<a id="chap09fn16text"></a><a href="#chap09fn16">16</a>]  On February
25, by which time news of the conquest of Tokar by Osman
Digna, the ablest of the Mahdi's lieutenants, had reached
England, Mr. Labouchere asked the Secretary for War
whether it was within the discretion of General Graham to
advance beyond Suakim against Osman Digna.  Hartington
replied oracularly that that appeared to him a question
highly undesirable to answer and that the general object
of Graham's instructions had been already stated to the
House.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P214"></a>214}</span>
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wilfrid Blunt's Diary for April 4, 1884, records the
following conversation with Mr. Labouchere: "Lunched
with Labouchere.  He is more practical, and we have
discussed every detail of the policy to be suggested to
Gladstone.  He will feel the ground through Herbert Gladstone,
which is his way of consulting the oracle.  He told me the
history of Gordon's mission.  Gordon's idea had been to go
out and make friends with the Mahdi, and to have absolutely
nothing to do with Baring or the Khedive, or with anybody
in Egypt.  He was going to Suakim straight, where he
counted upon one of the neighbouring Sheiks, whose sons'
lives he had saved or spared, and his mission was to be one
entirely of peace.  But the Foreign Office and Baring caught
hold of him as he passed through Egypt, and made him stop
to see the Khedive, and so he was befooled into going to
Khartoum as the Khedive's lieutenant.  Now he had failed
altogether in his mission of peace, and the Government had
recalled him more than once in the last few days, but he had
refused to come back.  Gladstone had decided absolutely
to recall all the troops in Egypt when Hicks' defeat was
heard of, and was in a great rage.  The expedition to Suakim
had been forced upon him by the Cabinet, and Hartington
had taken care to give Graham no special instructions, so
that he might fight without orders.  This Graham, of course,
had done, and Gladstone, more angry still, had gone down
to sulk at Coombe.  Now he would stand it no longer, and
he had let Hartington in by the speech he had made last
night.  Nobody expected it.  Labouchere thought the
moment most favourable for a new move."[<a id="chap09fn17text"></a><a href="#chap09fn17">17</a>]  And on May
19 Mr. Labouchere asked in the House: "Whether, for the
satisfaction of those who believe that it has never been
brought to the knowledge of the Mahdi and of the Soudanese
who are engaged in military operations what the object of
the mission of General Gordon is, he will consider the
feasibility of conveying to them that Her Majesty's Government,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P215"></a>215}</span>
in sending an English General to the Soudan, only desired
to effect by peaceful means the withdrawal of the Egyptian
troops, employés, and other foreigners who many wish to
leave the country, and whether he will take steps to enter
into diplomatic relations with the Mahdi, or whomsoever
else may be the governing power in the Soudan, in order to
prevent if possible all further effusion of blood, to establish
a fixed frontier between Egypt and the Soudan, and to effect
an arrangement by which General Gordon and those who
may wish to accompany him will be enabled peaceably to
withdraw from the Soudan."[<a id="chap09fn18text"></a><a href="#chap09fn18">18</a>]  Mr. Gladstone replied to
Mr. Labouchere's question, finishing his remarks with these
words: "Whatever measures the Government take will be
in the direction indicated by the question&mdash;to make effective
arrangements with regard to putting all the difficulties at
an end."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Labouchere, to whom, as a Radical and a Nationalist,
the position of the Mahdi appealed, did not confine
himself to work in Parliament.  Mr. Wilfrid Blunt was
attempting to negotiate with Mr. Gladstone to stop the
war, which had followed Gordon's death, and had taken
Mr. Labouchere into his confidence.  Mr. Labouchere wrote to
Mr. Blunt on February 20, 1885, as follows:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
DEAR BLUNT,&mdash;I had a talk with H(erbert) G(ladstone)
last night.  He wants to know what evidence can be given&mdash;that
the man who came to me was Arabi's Minister of Police at
Cairo, and what was his name&mdash;and that the Mahdi's man is
the Mahdi's man.  It is clear that so far he is right.  If the
latter has no credentials he should get them.  Let us assume
that he either has them or can get them.  Then there must be a
basis of terms.  I would suggest then that the Soudan, with the
exception of the Port of Suakim, be recognised as an independent
state under, if wished, the suzerainty of the Sultan, and that all
Egyptian Pashas who wish to leave it be allowed to leave it.
</p>

<p class="quote">
If the credentials hold water, and if these terms are agreed to,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P216"></a>216}</span>
then the Mahdi's man should write them out and say that he
will agree to them.
</p>

<p class="quote">
But it is very essential that nothing should be known about
the matter.  I should have to work others in the Cabinet, and,
if necessary, to appeal to Parliament.  Clearly we could not
send a mission to the Mahdi, but if an agreement were come to,
an emissary from the Mahdi and one from our Government might
meet for details.  What I want is to establish a discussion with
the Mahdi&mdash;the rest would follow.&mdash;Yours truly,
</p>

<p class="quote">
H. LABOUCHERE.
</p>

<p class="quote">
P.S.&mdash;You see, if something is to be done to stop this war,
we must leave the vague, and come to hard and fast facts.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
In elucidation of the above letter Mr. Blunt writes to
me on February 20, 1913: "The person referred to in your
uncle's letter of February 20, 1885, is clearly Ismail Bey
Jowdat, who acted as Prefect of Police at Cairo during the
war of 1882....  Later he came to London in connection
with negotiations I was attempting to get entered into by
Gladstone with the Mahdi, through Sezzed Jamal ed Din,
as to which I was in communication with your uncle....
I had, no doubt, sent Jowdat to your uncle, and, at one time,
it seemed as if we were likely to succeed in getting a mission
sent or negotiations of some kind entered into to stop the
war....  Jowdat was never himself an agent of the Mahdi,
but he was for the time with Jamal ed Din, who was in
communication with Khartoum...."
</p>

<p>
Communication with the Mahdi was apparently not easy,
for we find Mr. Labouchere writing again to Mr. Blunt the
following month (March 4, 1885):
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
It appears to me that there will be a pause in our Soudan
operations.  It might therefore be desirable to take advantage
of this in order to learn on what terms an agreement might be
come to between us and the Soudanese.  Those in Parliament
who, like myself, see no reason why we should interfere in the
internal affairs of that country would be greatly strengthened,
were we to know the precise views of the Mahdi.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P217"></a>217}</span>
</p>

<p class="quote">
I would therefore suggest to you that, if possible, his agent
should let us know definitely, and after conversation with the
Mahdi, whether the latter would agree to the following terms:
</p>

<p class="quote">
1. The recognition on the part of England of the independence
of the Soudan, and of the Mahdi as its ruler.
</p>

<p class="quote">
2. The Northern frontier of the Soudan to be drawn at or
near Wady Halfa; the Eastern frontier to exclude Suakim and
the coast.
</p>

<p class="quote">
3. The Mahdi to pledge himself not to molest any Soudanese
who have taken our side, and to allow all who wish to leave the
country to do so.
</p>

<p class="quote">
4. The Mahdi to receive a Consular and Diplomatic Agent
at Khartoum; to allow all foreigners to carry on their business
unmolested in the Soudan.
</p>

<p class="quote">
5. The establishment of some sort of Consular Courts.
</p>

<p class="quote">
6. If possible some clause with regard to the export of slaves
forbidding it.
</p>

<p class="quote">
It is our object to meet the assertion of the Government that
the Mahdi is a religious fanatic with whom it is impossible to
treat, because he does not regard himself, alone, as the temporal
ruler of the Soudan, but as a spiritual leader of Islam against
Christianity&mdash;a species of Oriental Peter the Hermit.  What we
want to show is that he is the proper ruler of the Soudan, and
that, whilst it will be open to any one outside that country to
regard him as a prophet, he seeks to establish no temporal sway
beyond the Soudan.  If the Mahdi would declare his assent to
the above terms, I am convinced that popular feeling here, and
the real wishes of the members of the Government, would soon
bring this war to a close, and that in a very short time we and the
Mahdi would be the best of friends.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
It seems unlikely that the terms laid down in this letter
were suggested by Mr. Labouchere without consultation
with Mr. Herbert Gladstone.
</p>

<p>
He missed no opportunity in Parliament of fighting the
good fight of Radical principles.  At one moment he is
pointing out the two cardinal heresies in the policy of the
Government&mdash;one political and the other financial: "The
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P218"></a>218}</span>
political heresy is that we insist on putting up the Khedive
and maintaining him in power against his subjects.  The
result is that we are absolutely hated in Egypt, and wherever
we are not hated we are regarded with contempt."  The
financial heresy is that "we always insist in our treatment
of Egyptian finance that the payment of interest on the debt
should come first, and the expenses of administration second.
The result of this policy is over-taxation, the postponement
of reform, and a deficit."[<a id="chap09fn19text"></a><a href="#chap09fn19">19</a>]  The policy of the Liberal Government
was in reality, though not in profession, he asserted,
Jingo policy, and the Radicals who had worked for
Mr. Gladstone's return to power, relying on his Midlothian
speeches, had been jockeyed.  If only Mr. Gladstone would
take his (Labouchere's) advice.  No doubt the Prime
Minister when thinking the matter over would say&mdash;Why
did I not follow the member for Northampton?  I should
not have been in such a mess as I am now.  For his own part
Mr. Labouchere stood by the policy of the Midlothian
campaign, when the Prime Minister denounced the Jingo
policy of annexation and war.  If any one had then said:
"You will acquire power and become the most powerful
Minister England has had for many a day; you will bombard
Alexandria; you will massacre Egyptians at Tel-el-Kebir
and Suakim, and you will go on a sort of wild-cat expedition
into the wilds of Ethiopia in order to put down a prophet"
the right honourable gentleman would have replied in the
words of Hazael to the King of Syria&mdash;"Is thy servant a
dog that he should do this thing?"[<a id="chap09fn20text"></a><a href="#chap09fn20">20</a>]
</p>

<p>
This kind of sword-play went on day after day in the
House, and it is impossible to doubt that, although Mr.
Labouchere was unquestionably sincere in deploring the
policy of the Government, he must have greatly enjoyed the
opportunity which it afforded him of displaying his wit and
humour.  Mr. Gladstone did not always appreciate these
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P219"></a>219}</span>
qualities, and on one occasion, when Mr. Labouchere was
attempting to divide the House against the Government,
his object being, as he said, "not adverse to the Government,
but to strengthen the good intentions of the Prime Minister
in future," that much enduring statesman turned and
solemnly rebuked him for making an "inopportune and
superficial speech."[<a id="chap09fn21text"></a><a href="#chap09fn21">21</a>]
</p>

<p>
The case against the Government from the Radical
point of view was, of course, very obvious and easy to put,
nor was there anything particularly original about
Mr. Labouchere's arguments.  He rang the changes incessantly
on three points: the essential injustice of our position in
Egypt towards the Egyptians&mdash;the underlying venality of
the Government's position owing to their connection with
the bondholders&mdash;and the monstrous expense to the British
taxpayer of British military intervention.  It was not the
matter of his charges, but the manner in which he made
them that delighted the House.  Sometimes he would lay
aside his dialectical weapons and let the facts speak for
themselves.  One day he asks the Secretary for War if his
attention has been drawn to the following statements in
the <i>Times</i> of May 7:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
Daylight broke almost imperceptibly.  We were nearer the
village of Dhakool, when the friendly scouts came running in
with the news that the inhabitants were at prayer, and that if we
attacked at once we should catch them.  General Graham pushed
on with a troop of the Bengal Lancers....  The enemy fled
on camels in all directions, and the Mounted Infantry and Camel
corps, coming up, gave chase.  Some two hundred attempted to
stand, and showed a disposition to come at us, but evidently
lost heart and disappeared, not before having at least twenty
men killed....  It was curious to witness the desperate efforts
of the enemy to drive their flocks up the steep mountain side,
turning now and again to fire on the Bengal Lancers.  The
"Friendlies" tried to cut off the flocks, and succeeded in catching
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P220"></a>220}</span>
some thousands of animals....  The village was looted and
burnt....  We also destroyed the well with gun-cotton....
But, for our being unaware of the existence of some narrow hillock
walks up which the enemy retired, we might have exterminated
them.  Our loss has been hitherto only two Mounted Infantry
men wounded....  We have done the enemy all the harm we
could, thus fulfilling the primary object of war.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Lord Hartington could find nothing to say, but that such
incidents were unfortunately inseparable from war.[<a id="chap09fn22text"></a><a href="#chap09fn22">22</a>]
</p>

<p>
It may be doubted, however, whether Mr. Labouchere's
advocacy did very much for his cause, or for his own
reputation as a serious politician.  The British public (and the
House of Commons is a sort of microcosm of the British
public) finds it hard to believe in sincerity accompanied by
banter and persiflage.  Not so are Englishmen wont to
express their conscientious convictions.  Mr. Labouchere
was, of course, not an Englishman.  He was a Frenchman
and, as I have said before, in his mentality a lineal descendant
of Voltaire.  He could hardly hope to succeed where
John Bright had failed.
</p>

<p>
That Mr. Labouchere's attitude on the subject of Egypt
was appreciated by the Egyptians is proved by a perusal
of the letters he received from Arabi in exile, long after the
subject had ceased to be a stone on which the Radical axe
could be ground.  I append some of these, and another
letter from Mr. Labouchere to Mr. Wilfrid Blunt on the
subject of the Exiles.

<p class="quote">
MY DEAR SIR,&mdash;I beg the liberty to trouble you with this in
the hope of your being able to learn more of the state of our health
than you have been hitherto.  One of the most eminent medical
practitioners in Ceylon, Dr. Vandort, left for England in the
last week in the German mail steamship <i>Preussen</i>.  I have asked
him to call on you and Sir William Gregory and inform you of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P221"></a>221}</span>
the actual state of such of us as he has attended on.  By the
death of Dr. White we lost our best evidence, and it pleased those
in authority not to heed at all the opinion of our regular medical
advisers and to rely on that of gentlemen who, whatever their
high standing and attainments, had but one opportunity of
seeing us.  Had they questioned also those who attended on us
and our families for years they might have been better able to
form an opinion.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I am now suffering very much from my eyes, being scarcely
able to read anything, and am waiting until an oculist from
Madras could examine them and tell me what I may expect.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Pray forgive me for troubling with this letter.  We have so
few of your kind feelings and position to look up to&mdash;and if we
are too importunate we would only beg to be pardoned.
</p>

<p class="quote">
In the hope that you are in the enjoyment of the blessing of
health, and begging the kind acceptance of all respectful
regards&mdash;I remain, yours most obediently,

<p class="quote">
MY DEAR SIR,&mdash;I had the great pleasure to receive your kind
letters of the 2d and 8th October, and should have replied earlier
but for having had to communicate with my brethren in exile,
and for there being time before the next meeting of Parliament.
We beg your kindly acceptance of our grateful thanks.
</p>

<p class="quote">
We have been officially informed of the decision of H.M.'s
Government on our memorial to Lord Salisbury, but for which
we were prepared by yourself and Sir William Gregory; and also
by Lord de la Warr, who very kindly sent to me copies of the
papers (Egypt, No. 1, 1891), printed for both Houses of
Parliament, in March last, and of his speeches and Lord Salisbury's
reply in May and June last.  I now send copies as requested of
the medical certificates had by Toulba Pasha and the late Abdulal
Pasha since the memorial, also the Colonial Secretary's letter
to us and my reply.  [All these were enclosed with this letter.]
</p>

<p class="quote">
You will permit me to ask your notice of Riaz Pasha's Memorandum
of July 9, 1890, to the Foreign Office concluding with:
"H.M's Government should in any case remember that the exiles
were pardoned and allowances granted to them on the express
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P222"></a>222}</span>
condition that they should remain at some distant spot, such as
the island of Ceylon."  On this rather qualified assertion it would
quite do to refer to Mr. Broadley's book <i>How we Defended Arabi
and his Friends</i>, where the terms of the arrangement which put
an end to the proceedings in connection with our "trial" will be
found.  Mr. Broadley and Mr. Napier could not, as I cannot,
in honour reveal more than they have done, but my steadfast
friend, Mr. Blunt, was not so constrained to be reticent, and his
communications to the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i> showed what even the
great noble-minded General Gordon believed the nature and
extent of our exile to be.
</p>

<p class="quote">
We should not perhaps however complain of our not being
permitted to end our days in the land of our birth, although what
harm that, or our being in Cyprus, could now do I cannot
conceive.  That none of us have desired or sought in the least to
be disloyal to our parole the testimony of Sir Arthur Gordon
to our conduct should be sufficient.  If all my correspondence,
family and other, for the last nine years were read, or any of the
hundreds of my visitors, from every part of the world, were
questioned, nothing would there be to show the least wish to
disturb or stay the progress of my loved native land since my
poor efforts failed.
</p>

<p class="quote">
If you would kindly refer to Mr. Broadley's book you will
find Lord Dufferin's scheme in 1883 for the reorganisation of my
country, and my views on Egyptian reform in 1882.  After nine
years, when almost the whole of that scheme and so many of
my humble views have been successfully carried out, is it possible
that any one beyond my personal enemies in my own country
could deem me capable of even dreaming of doing anything to
see her in misery again?  My greatest trust is yet what it was
when I wrote to the <i>Times</i> from my prison in 1882: "I hope the
people of England will complete the work which I commenced.
If England accomplishes this task, and thus really gives Egypt
to the Egyptians, she will then make clear to the world the real
aim and object of Arabi the Rebel" (Mr. Broadley's book,
p. 349).  I cannot hope to see the time, but it must come under
such auspices when Egypt will cease to be a "reproach to the
nations," Islam although she be.
</p>

<p class="quote">
My fellow exiles and I have considered much on the subject
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P223"></a>223}</span>
of the parole you suggest in regard to Cyprus.  Our simple
parole was all that Lord Dufferin required of us when exiled.
We gave it, and he was satisfied.  We have honourably kept our
word, and it is only now, when we find our place of sojourn proving
so increasingly injurious to the health of most of us and our
families, that we pray for a change to a more congenial climate.
In every other respect we could not dream nor hope for a better
home of exile.  We leave everything to your judgment.  If you
think a repetition of our parole necessary, or of any use, we shall
gladly give it again, although our first, religiously observed, has
been so slighted; and we shall send it to you as soon as you may
desire it.  You have done much for us, and our return for it all
could only be gratefully felt, not expressed; and you will permit
us to leave it to you to do for us whatever more in your judgment
may be expedient, and, whatever that may be, permit us to
assure you of our fullest trust.
</p>

<p class="quote">
If any prospect of the change of residence we seek is hopeless,
and Lord Salisbury should adhere to his wish to keep us here, I
may but beg your best endeavour to obtain the increase of allowance
I have applied for in my letter to the Colonial Secretary,
to enable me to have the benefit of such change as the variable
climate of this island could in some degree afford.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I had the pleasure last week of two kind visits by Mr. J. R. Cox,
M.P., on his return home from Australia in the <i>Orizaba</i>.
He mentioned your request and his promise to see me if he came
to Colombo, and your desire that he should learn from me all I
had to say; and he asked me to give him a statement, which I
have done to the best of my ability both by word of mouth and
in writing.  He said he had been long away, and had not seen
the papers Lord de la Warr sent me until then.  I need not say
how deeply gratifying it was to hear from him of your interest
in us and of your exertions on our behalf, and of the wide feelings
of sympathy you have raised for us.
</p>

<p class="quote">
You will forgive me for trespassing on your time and work
with this long letter; and if I have been led to say anything that
I have troubled your attention with before, I may only beg the
extension of your indulgence for it.  Placed as I am now, able
to think only of the past, and with no hope for life's future on
earth, and deprived more and more of my greatest solace, study,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P224"></a>224}</span>
by the growing weakness of sight, I fear that my communications
to you and to those who have likewise generously extended sympathy
to us in our strait are of too melancholy a tinge.  As any
prospect of better days seems all but closed to us, we may but
bow in humble resignation and submission to the Divine Will.
When this letter comes to you it will be your great season of joy
and peace.  Permit me and my family to offer you our best
regards and wishes for many a happy enjoyment together and
return of the things to you and all dear to you.&mdash;And believe me,
yours most gratefully and sincerely,

MY DEAR BLUNT,&mdash;Jingoism under Rosebery reigns supreme.
I will, however, see if anything can be done about Arabi.  Your
details are very interesting respecting the late events in Egypt.
Cannot the Khedive be induced to do this?: Get his Chamber
to pass a resolution declaring that Egypt wishes for independence
of all European intervention, and trusts that the British occupation
will cease.  If it did this we should be able to meet the
persistent statements that the Fellaheen wants us and loves us.
The Turkish Pashas might agree so as to spite us, but if once the

</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap09fn2"></a>
[<a href="#chap09fn2text">2</a>] I have taken this account of the Cyprus Convention
and its results at the
Berlin Congress from Mr. Blunt's
<i>Secret History of the English Occupation of
Egypt</i>.  He says in a footnote (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 277):
"I have given the story of the
arrangement made with Waddington as I heard
it first from Lord Lytton at
Simla in May, 1879.  The details were contained
in a letter which he showed
me written to him from Berlin,
while the Congress was still sitting, by a former
diplomatic colleague, and have since been confirmed
to me from more than one
quarter, though with variations.
In regard to the main feature of the agreement,
the arrangement about Tunis, I had it very plainly stated to me in the
autumn of 1884 by Count Corti,
who had been Italian Ambassador at the
Congress.  According to his account,
the shock of the revelation to Disraeli
had been so great that he took to his bed,
and for four days did not appear at
the sittings, leaving Lord Salisbury
to explain matters as he best could.  He
said that there had been no open rupture
with Waddington, the case having
been submitted by Waddington to his
fellow-ambassadors, who agreed that
it was not one that could possibly
be publicly disputed: <i>Il faut la guerre ou
se taire</i>.  The agreement was a verbal
one between Waddington and Salisbury,
but was recorded in a despatch
subsequently written by the French
Ambassador in London in which he reminded
Salisbury of the Convention
conversation held in Berlin,
and so secured its acknowledgment in writing."

<h3>
CHAPTER X
<br><br>
HENRY LABOUCHERE'S RADICALISM
</h3>

<p>
Before dealing further with the part played by Labouchere
in Irish legislation, it will be necessary to consider
his view of English politics as a whole.  He had not at first
been an enthusiastic partisan of Home Rule.  He had even
gone the length at Northampton of saying that he himself
was no Home Ruler.  Yet, in point of fact, no English
member was a more zealous advocate of Irish claims than he.
Why was this?  His motives, as I have been able to gather
them from many conversations with him on the subject,
were twofold: His Radical soul was disgusted by what,
in the face of the Irish attitude, was the only alternative
to Home Rule, namely coercion, and he realised that the
only effective way to "dish the Whigs," whom he hated
even more than the Conservatives, was to use the Irish
vote.
</p>

<p>
The second motive was by far the stronger.  He had a
definite conception of Radical government to which he
would undoubtedly have sacrificed hecatombs of Irish
patriots if necessary.  As a matter of fact, the Irish patriots
happened to be a useful means towards his end, the
establishment of such a government.  Hence his alliance with
them.  When Mr. Gladstone and his Whig-Radical Government
were faced in 1880 with the Irish question in so acute
a form, Labouchere saw a real possibility ahead of
establishing a Radical as distinguished from a merely Liberal
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P226"></a>226}</span>
Government.  The protagonist of his scheme was
Mr. Chamberlain, already a member of the Cabinet, and, in
the natural course of events, the almost certain successor
of the already venerable statesman whose name had become
the war-cry of English Liberalism.
</p>

<p>
With Mr. Chamberlain as Prime Minister almost anything
might happen: the Lords and the Church might go,
England might become, in all save the name, a republic.
Mr. Chamberlain was the one statesman with whom he
found himself in complete agreement as to the articles of
the Radical faith, and in his future he saw the future of the
party and of England.  He wrote to him on July 3, 1883:
"I was caught young and sent to America; there I imbibed
the political views of the country, so that my Radicalism
is not a joke, but perfectly earnest.  My opinion on most of
the institutions of this country is that of Americans&mdash;that
they are utterly absurd and ridiculous.  Nothing would
give me greater pleasure than to see you leader of the House
of Commons, with a Parliament pledged to the most drastic
reforms.  This is the aim of my humble endeavours, but,
in the nature of things, a member below the gangway has
not the same responsibilities as a Minister, and, if he is a
Radical, necessarily is more advanced than a composite
Cabinet.  He has, too, to make motions or to hold his tongue.
For instance, my amendment yesterday evening on titles
was regarded in the House of Commons as a joke.  But go
to any meeting of even Liberals, and you would find that
it was essentially a popular one.  The real trouble in the
House of Commons is that the Radicals below the gangway
are such a miserable lot, and seem ashamed of their opinions.
The Whigs, on the contrary, out of office act solidly together.
This leads the public to suppose that your views are in a
small minority in the House of Commons.  If the Whigs
are ready to pull a coach half way to what they consider a
precipice, they must be greater fools than I take them to be.
They do not act openly, but they conspire secretly.  So long,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P227"></a>227}</span>
however, as they consent to work in harness, they ought to
be encouraged.  You have told them the goal, and I am
certain that this declaration has done more to strengthen
radicalism than anything that has happened for long.  So
I am perfectly contented, and quite ready to leave well
alone."
</p>

<p>
Alas for the schemes of mortals!  The very element on
which Labouchere relied for the strengthening of the Radical
cause in the Cabinet was to prove to Mr. Chamberlain
himself the parting of the ways.  The statesman who was to
reach the highest power on the shoulders of Irish voters,
when it came to the point, would have none of such support.
The corner-stone fell out of the grandiose edifice that
Labouchere had planned, the palace of Armida crumbled in the
dust.  Bitter, indeed, was his disappointment.  It was
characteristic of him in these circumstances to lose his head
and throw up the game.  The reader will remember how,
as a boy, he described his own character at the gaming-table:
"In playing even I failed because, although I theoretically
discovered systems by which I was likely to win, yet in
practice I could command myself so little that, upon a slight
loss, I left all to chance."  He lacked the patience or the
industry of mind to reconstruct his schemes, and when
Mr. Chamberlain was lost to the Radical party, Labouchere's
constructive imagination seems never to have recovered
the blow.  He continued the war with abuse of privilege,
absurdity consecrated by tradition, and the other heads of
the hydra with which his party fought, but the tone of his
attacks was not the same as before the Home Rule split.
Too often they degenerated into mere party criticism, the
note of personal invective, one might almost say of spite,
becoming more prominent in them.  He had lost faith in
success, because the combination by which he had hoped to
win had failed, and he could not, or would not, think out
another.  It was this consciousness of failure&mdash;of personal
failure as he saw it, so closely had he identified himself with
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P228"></a>228}</span>
his hopes&mdash;that inspired the peculiar bitterness with which,
in and out of season, he attacked the statesman whom he
held responsible for the altered situation.  He did not, as
his correspondence will show, give up hope for some time
of Mr. Chamberlain's return to the party, but, when he had
at last given up all such hope, nothing was too bad for "Joe."  In
the pages of <i>Truth</i>, in the Reform Club, in the lobby of the
House of Commons, he constantly held forth to all who would
read or listen on the "crimes" of the man who had divided
the Liberal party against itself.  He manifested no such
bitterness against Bright or Hartington; but when Mr. Chamberlain
fell from grace, he fell as no private individual,
but as the symbol of the Radical party.  With him, according
to Labouchere, the party fell, and with the party his
immediate hopes for the regeneration of England.  Those
hopes had, with ample justification for their existence, run
high when Messrs. Chamberlain and Dilke joined
Mr. Gladstone's administration in 1880.  Labouchere based his
scheme on the permanence of Mr. Chamberlain's Radicalism,
and upon the fact that, in the natural course of events, a
successor would very shortly have to be found for
Mr. Gladstone.  Both these, at the time, reasonable previsions
were falsified by destiny.  Mr. Gladstone remained for
another fourteen years leader of the party, and Mr. Chamberlain
became a Liberal Unionist.  The years between
1880 and 1887 were, in so far as his political life was
concerned, the most important of Labouchere's life.  Until he
saw that his game was finally spoiled by a totally unexpected
fall of the cards, he did not for one instant relax his efforts
to reach the end towards which he had planned to work.
His patience was remarkable, his foresight uncanny, except
in the all-important direction from which the blow that
finally shattered his hopes descended.
</p>

<p>
It is interesting, in the light of subsequent events, to
read the article which he wrote for the February number of
the <i>Fortnightly Review</i> in 1884, in which he set forth with
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P229"></a>229}</span>
characteristic freedom of expression his views upon Radicals
as differing from Whigs.  "A Radical," he declares early in
the article, "has been defined as an earnest Liberal," and he
goes on to describe, in uncompromising terms, the faith of
the earnest Liberal&mdash;or true Radical.  "The Government
Bill," he wrote, "assimilating the County to the Borough
Franchise is to be encouraged, although it does not go far
enough, to the extent, <i>i.e.</i>, of Adult manhood suffrage.  It
will be for Radicals to take care strenuously to oppose every
scheme which is a sham and not a reality.  Let us all who
are good Liberals labour to obtain a good suffrage Bill and
a good redistribution Bill.  This will strengthen our
Parliamentary position, and we may fairly anticipate that
Manhood Suffrage, electoral districts, triennial Parliaments,
and payment of members will follow."  The following
extract shows very clearly Mr. Labouchere's opinions on
what may be called the technique of legislation:
</p>

<p>
"The life of a Parliament is too long.  Three years is
the maximum period for which it should be elected.  At the
end of this time it is out of touch with the electorates.
Promises and pledges made at the hustings are evaded,
because each member thinks they will be forgotten before
he has again to seek the suffrages of his electors; whilst
Ministers are too apt to put off, until the period for a fresh
election approaches, any drastic legislation to which they
are pledged as leaders of their party.  It is probable that,
were the duration of Parliament limited to three years, as
much political legislation would take place in this period
as is now the case in the five or six years which is the average
life of a Parliament.  The fear of a speedy reckoning with
electors would be ever before the eyes of Ministers and
members.  The 'Can't you leave it alone?' of Lord
Melbourne would be replaced by 'We must do much and do it
speedily, for the day of reckoning is near at hand.'  Long
Parliaments are as fatal to sound business as long credits
are to sound trade.  It is questionable, indeed, whether
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P230"></a>230}</span>
three years is not too long for the duration of a Parliament.
We should move in all probability more quickly, were the
nation to insist upon an annual stocktaking."
</p>

<p>
The arguments, from the democratic point of view, in
favour of the payment of members are thus set forth:
</p>

<p>
"The payment of members would do more to democratise
our legislature, and consequently our legislation, than any
other measure that can be conceived.  At present, members,
as a rule, are rich men.  Many of them mean well, but they
fatally take a rich man's view of all matters, and are far too
much inclined to think that everything is for the best in a
world where, although there may be many blanks, they at
least have drawn a prize in life's lottery.  So long as the
choice of the poor men is between this and that rich man, so
long will our legislation run in the groove of class prejudice.
The poor man will not be the social equal of the rich man,
and our laws will be made rather with a view to the happiness
and interests of the few than of the many.  All who are
Conservative in heart know this, and for this reason the
payment of members, which is the natural outcome of a
recognition that a labourer is worthy of his hire, finds in
them such bitter opponents.  If a Minister is paid for being
a Minister, it is only logical that a member should be paid
for being a member.  People must live.  To refuse payment
to members is to limit the choice of electorates to those very
men who are not likely to see things with the same eyes as
the majority of the men who constitute the electorates.
Parliaments should be composed of rich men and of poor
men.  No one would advocate the exclusion of rich men.
Why, then, should a condition of things continue which
practically results in the exclusion of the poor man?"
</p>

<p>
Never has the Radical view of the House of Lords and
the Crown been more forcibly expressed than in the following:
</p>

<p>
"The Whigs seem to know that &mdash;&mdash; is in favour of the
abolition of a House of hereditary legislators.  Let us hope
that they are correct.  We are frequently told that the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P231"></a>231}</span>
people love, honour, and respect the House of Lords.  Let
any one who entertains this notion allude to this assembly
at a popular political gathering in any part of the country,
and he will find his illusion rudely dispelled.  There are
earnest Radicals who hold that there ought to be two
legislative Chambers, and not one; although why they think so,
it is difficult to say, for in every country where the
two-Chamber system prevails, either one of them has become a
mere useless court of registration, or the two are engaged in
perpetual disputes, to the great detriment of public business.
No Radical, however, is in favour of our existing Upper
Chamber.  If he were, he would not be a Radical.  What
an hereditary legislator ought to be is well described by
Burke in his letter to the Duke of Bedford.  What our
hereditary legislators are we know by bitter experience.
They almost all belong to one particular class&mdash;that of the
great landlords.  When any attempt is made to deal with
the gross absurdities of our land system, they rally almost
to a man to its defence, not from natural depravity, but
from the natural bias of every one to consider that what
benefits him must be for the best.  The majority of them
are Conservatives; even those who call themselves Liberals
are the mildest of Whigs.  When a Conservative Administration
is in power they are harmless for good or evil.  When
a Liberal Administration is in power they are actively evil.
Such an administration represents the deliberate will of the
nation.  Before bringing in a Bill, however, it has to be
toned down, lest it should meet with opposition in the Lords.
Nevertheless it does meet with opposition there.  The Lords
do not throw it out, but emasculate it with amendments;
then when it comes back to the Commons a bargain is struck
that, if the Commons will agree to some of these amendments,
the Lords will not insist upon the others.  Thus, no matter
what may be the majority possessed by a Liberal ministry
in the House of Commons, it can never legislate as it wishes,
but in a sense between what it wishes and what the Conservative
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P232"></a>232}</span>
majority in the Lords wish.  In great and important
questions it almost always obeys its Leader like a flock of
sheep, and thus one man is able to provoke a dissolution,
not only when he thinks that this is in the interests of the
country, but when he imagines it to be in the interests of
his party.  It is asserted that the House of Lords is useful
because its rejection of a Bill is an appeal to the country
against a House of Commons which is acting in opposition
to the popular will.  It is not easy to understand on what
grounds the Lords are supposed to know what the popular
will is; and, indeed, they never do, for there is not one single
case on record where, when the Lords have appealed to the
country against a decision of the House of Commons, the
verdict has gone in favour of the former.  Although rich,
the peers are not independent.  They are, in fact, remarkable
for their abnormal greed.  Because they are by the
chance of birth legislators, they insist upon decorations,
distinctions, and salaries being showered upon them and
their relations.  In the Financial Reform Almanack for
this year there is an interesting calculation of the amounts
that living dukes, marquises, and earls, and their relations,
and those that have died since 1850, have received out of
the public exchequer.  The dukes figure for £9,760,000,
the marquises for £8,305,950, and the earls for £48,181,292;
total £66,247,242.  The voracity of a vestryman is nothing
to compare with that of the British nobleman.  Eighty-three
peers are privy councillors; 55 have received decorations;
192 are connected with the army and navy; 62 are railway
directors; their total rental is £11,872,333, and they possess
14,251,132 acres; yet in pay and pensions they absorb
annually £639,865, and whenever there is a change of
administration they clamour for well-paid sinecures about the
Court, and other such sops, like a pack of hungry hounds.
<i>Les soutiens de l'État</i> indeed!  <i>Comme une corde soutient
un pendu!</i>  The greater number of them are obscure thanes,
who never take an active part in legislation or attend in their
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P233"></a>233}</span>
seats; and they are summoned to London by their party
leader whenever it is necessary to vote down some Liberal
enactment, which has been passed after long and careful
consideration by the elected representatives of the nation,
and for this service to the State they generally insist upon
receiving an equivalent&mdash;a ribbon, a Lord Lieutenancy, or
an office for a relative or a dependent....
</p>

<p>
"Radicals are essentially practical, and are not accustomed
to waste or misdirect their energies.  They do not
approve of the fuss and feathers of a Court, and they regard
its ceremonies with scant respect, for they are inclined to
think that they conduce to a servile spirit, which is
degrading to humanity.  They admit, however, that the scheme
of a monarch who reigns but does not rule has its advantages
in an empire such as ours, where a connecting link between
the mother country and the colonies is desirable.  Their
objection to the present state of things is mainly based upon
financial grounds.  Admitting that there is to be a hereditary
figure-head, they cannot understand why it should cost so
much, why funds which are voted to the monarch should be
expended in salaries to noblemen for the performance of
ceremonial service, or why the children of the monarch
should receive such enormous annuities."  He quoted an
occasion when the disloyalty of Radicals was supposed to
have been amply proved.  One of them had voted for an
amendment of Sir Charles Dilke when Lord Beaconsfield's
Government had proposed an allowance of £25,000 per
annum to the Duke of Connaught.  "It would have been
more to the purpose to show," he said, "why this young
gentleman should receive so very ample a pension for
condescending to be the son of his parents.  Nothing has
conduced more to shake that decent respect for the living
symbol of the State, which goes by the name of royalty,
than the ever-recurring rattle of the money-box.  Radicals
do not perceive why the children of the monarch should be
made public pensioners any more than the children of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P234"></a>234}</span>
Lord Chancellor.  They know that Her Majesty lives in
retirement, and that she has a wholesome contempt for the
costly ceremonies of a Court; they are aware that as a
necessary consequence she has sufficient accumulations to keep
her children in comfort.  They ask, therefore, why their
maintenance should be thrown on the country, and why, if
so, this should be on so very costly a scale.  They consider,
it is true, that Her Majesty has too large a Civil List; yet
although they are not deceived by the 'pious fraud' which
assumes that the monarch is the owner of the Crown domains
and surrenders them on accession to the throne in consideration
of a money equivalent for what they produce, they have
no burning desire to interfere with existing arrangements
during the lifetime of the present incumbent, for they have
a sincere respect for the Queen, not only as the constitutional
head of the State, but also on account of her excellent
personal qualities.  They are of opinion, however, that when
provision is asked for the eldest son of the Prince of Wales,
this will be a fitting opportunity to inaugurate an entire
change in the financial relations of the Crown with the
country."
</p>

<p>
The Established Church, education, and the Land Laws
are thus drastically treated.
</p>

<p>
"The income of the Establishment is close upon £5,000,000
per annum.  It is the Church of a minority.  The greater
portion of its revenues were acquired by confiscation.  Its
division of them amongst its clergy is in defiance of all rule
and justice.  Cures of souls are matters of public barter.
Only the other day the secretary of a race-course company
bought the next presentation to a living in order to ensure
that the views of the next pastor should be sound on the
question of racing.  In every country except this the
principle has been recognised that so-called ecclesiastical
property is national property.  In some countries this principle
has been pushed to its ultimate consequences, in others it
has received a more restricted application.  Were we all
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P235"></a>235}</span>
members of the Established Church there might be some
plea for our devoting a portion of our property to the
maintenance of the Church's employés.  But the majority of us
are not churchmen.  Why then should we perpetuate so
invidious an application of national funds?  The vested
rights of living incumbents should be respected, and perhaps
it would be only fair that the Church should retain those
funds that she has received from the liberality of private
donors within the last few years.  On an excessive estimate
this would amount to £1,000,000 per annum.  We require
the remaining £4,000,000 per annum for educational
purposes, and we mean to have them....
</p>

<p>
"Whilst all Radicals are agreed that our land system
requires a thorough reform, all are perhaps not in accord as
to the details of that reform.  Some are followers of
Mr. George and demand the nationalisation of land; others&mdash;and
these are the wiser&mdash;whilst admitting that it is to be
regretted that the paramount proprietorship of the
community has been almost entirely ignored, hardly see their
way to resume it absolutely, nor do they admit that a person
who has acquired a legal title to a freehold can be divested
of it without fair compensation.  All, however, are agreed
that real estate has, in contradistinction to personal estate,
certain inherent qualities: it is limited in quantity, and it is
a natural instrument; consequently, the State has a right
to regulate the conditions of its tenure, and its transmission
from one individual to another.  We would legislate to
break up and destroy all huge domains; to make the occupier
to all practical intents the master of the soil which he
cultivates, and to secure to him not only fixity of tenure and
independence of a landlord's rules and caprices, but the
enjoyment of these rights at a fair and reasonable price.
A long succession of landlord legislatures have, in the words
of Mr. Cobden, 'robbed and bamboozled the people for
ages.'  All our laws affecting land have been made in order
to perpetuate its tenure in the hands of the few from generation
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P236"></a>236}</span>
to generation; to render its purchase difficult and
expensive; to free its owners from taxes and obligations, in
consideration of which their predecessors acquired lordship
over it from the State; and to give it an artificial value by
securing to its possessors social and political pre-eminence.
That there should be few Radicals amongst landlords is less
surprising than that any one who is not a landlord should
remain outside the Radical pale.  To suppose that when
Radicals have the power to place our land laws in harmony
with the good of the greatest numbers, or to imagine that
they will allow the <i>imperia in imperio</i> of huge domains to
continue, is to suppose that they will take to their heart of
hearts their 'robbers and bamboozlers.'  Landlords are a
mistake socially, politically, and economically.  The only
true proprietary rights in land are a reasonable interest on
sums spent in rendering it more productive, and this only
so long as the outlay continues to produce this result; to
talk of any other natural proprietary rights is as absurd as
it would be to talk of a man having a natural property in
the air that we breathe.  It is too late now, however, to
revert to first principles.  We must accept facts and
endeavour to make the best of them.  This we propose to do, and,
as a preliminary step, we demand the renewed imposition
of the land-tax at four shillings in the pound upon the full
true yearly value at a rack rent; that there should be no
more subventions in aid of local taxation from imperial
funds largely derived from taxation on food and drink; and
that landlords who will not use their land themselves should
be made to give it up to those who are ready and anxious to
use it."
</p>

<p>
Towards the end of the article Mr. Labouchere delivers
himself somewhat tentatively on the Irish question as
follows:
</p>

<p>
"It was said in the first session of the present
Parliament&mdash;and no one was more fond of using this argument than
Mr. Gladstone&mdash;that the limited number of Mr. Parnell's
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P237"></a>237}</span>
Parliamentary followers proved that the majority of the
constituencies was not with him.  Later on, when the error
of this estimate of his strength was perceived, it was alleged
that his influence was alone secured by terrorism.  Slowly
it had dawned upon the English mind that the vast majority
of Irishmen, rightly or wrongly, cordially and truly
sympathise with him.  No one now questions that he will sweep
Ireland at the next General Election.  On the doctrine of
probabilities, this will make him the arbiter between parties
at St. Stephen's.  How is this to be met?  The only
suggestion put forward as yet has been that both parties should
agree that the Irish vote is not to count on a party division.
But does any sane human being imagine that such a scheme
is practicable?  The 'ins' would always assent to it, but the
'outs' would defer their assent until they became the 'ins.'  It
is indeed becoming every day more and more clear that
we must either allow the Irish votes to reckon as other votes,
or that we must boldly assert that Ireland shall no longer
be represented in Parliament, because we disagree with the
representatives that it chooses.  There is no middle course;
and, if we accept the former, we shall have to allow Ireland
hereafter to decide as she best pleases on matters that only
locally regard her.  Most Radicals would be of opinion that
one Parliament for the entire United Kingdom is a better
system that one for Great Britain and another for Ireland.
But they would go a long way to establish a fair <i>modus
vivendi</i> between the two islands, and nothing that Mr. Parnell
has ever said can be adduced to show that he does not
entertain the same desire.  Most of his views recommend
themselves to Radicals, especially those in regard to land....
If the Irish wish for Home Rule why should they not
have it?  It surely would be easy to conceive a plan in which
that island would have a representative assembly that would
legislate upon all matters, except those reserved to the
Imperial Parliament.  These reservations might be
precisely the same as those which the American Constitution
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P238"></a>238}</span>
reserves to Congress in her relations with State
Governments.  Mr. Gladstone seemed inclined to accept this
solution in 1882, for, in a speech during the session of that
year, he asked the Irish members to submit their plan to the
House of Commons, whilst the only objection that occurred
to him was, that it might be difficult to find an arbiter
between the Imperial and the Irish legislature in case of any
conflict of jurisdiction&mdash;a difficulty which a cursory glance
at the American Constitution would have solved.  The
Irish are sound upon almost every question; they are even
more democratically inclined than we are.  We want their
aid and they want our aid.  Irish, English, and Scotch
Radicals should coalesce.  Mutual concessions may be necessary,
but this is always the case in political alliances.  That the
Irish should not love the English connection is hardly
surprising.  We are only now beginning to do them justice,
and we have accompanied this modicum of justice with a
Coercion Act, aimed not only at crime, but at legitimate
political agitation.  If we remove their grievances, if we
make Irishmen the true rulers of Ireland, and if we cease
to meddle in matters that concern them and not us, there
is no reason to suppose that they would wish to separate
from us any more than our colonies.  Separation would,
indeed, be as disadvantageous to them as to us."
</p>

<p>
A year or two later he gave clear expression to the same
Radical faith in the House of Commons in a speech which he
made on his own amendment to the motion that Mr. Speaker
do now leave the chair: "That in the opinion of this House
it is contrary to the true principles of representative
Government, and injurious to their efficiency, that any person
should be a member of one House of the Legislature by right
of birth, and it is therefore desirable to put an end to any
such existing rights."  "It has been pointed out to him,"
he said, "that these words might include Her Majesty,
which, of course, was not intended ... they had been
engaged in democratising, as far as they could, the Commons
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P239"></a>239}</span>
branch of the Legislature; but all their efforts would be
abortive, all their efforts at Parliamentary reform would be
illusory, if they allowed side by side with that House a
Legislative Assembly to exist, which, in its nature, was
aristocratic, and which had a right to tamper with and veto
the decisions of the nation, which were registered by the
House of Commons....  Members of the House of Lords
were neither elected nor selected for their merits.  They sat
by the merits of their ancestors, and, if we looked into the
merits of some of those ancestors, we should agree that the
less said about them the better.  The House of Lords
consisted of a class most dangerous to the community&mdash;the
class of rich men, the greater part of whose fortune was in
land.  It was asserted of them that the House of Lords was
recruited from the wisest and best in the country&mdash;that the
Lords were so wise and good that, in some mysterious way,
they were able to transmit their virtues to future generations
in <i>secula seculorum</i>.  The practice in the selection of those
gentlemen was not quite in accordance with this theory.
They consisted generally of two classes&mdash;of those who were
apparently successful politicians, and of those who were
undoubtedly successful money-grubbers.  He would take
a few examples, and, as he did not wish to be invidious, he
would take them from both sides of the House.  They all
knew and appreciated Sir R.  Assheton Cross, Mr. Sclater
Booth, Sir Thomas Brassey, and Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen.
What did they think of these gentlemen?  As members of
this House everybody respected and liked them; but they
were looked upon as decent sort of mediocrities of the
ordinary quality, which was converted, in course of time, into
administrative Ministers.  Take another class.  Why were
brewers selected as peers?  Simply because they, of late,
had accumulated very large fortunes by the sale of intoxicating
liquors, and for no other reason.  The names of Guinness,
Bass, and Allsopp had been long household words in every
public house in the country, but who ever heard of them as
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P240"></a>240}</span>
politicians?  Yet these gentlemen were considered to be the
very best men in the country to be converted into hereditary
peers.  Another class who made money were the financiers.
Lord Rothschild inherited a large fortune, and had increased
that fortune, and no doubt spent his money in the most
honourable way; but Lord Rothschild did nothing in the
House of Commons in any way to distinguish himself.
With brewers, when one was made a peer another must be
made a peer for advertisement.  So with financial houses;
when a Rothschild was made a peer, it was necessary to fish
up some one of the name of Baring, and one was converted
into Lord Revelstoke&mdash;a gentleman who, though probably
eminent in city circles, was hardly known to any one in that
House, and who had never taken part in politics.  So much
for the composition of the House of Lords....  Deducting
representative peers from Scotland and Ireland, and
deducting members of the Royal family, and deducting bishops
and archbishops, he found 470 peers sitting as hereditary
peers in the House of Lords.  He found that those peers
had annually distributed among them £389,163, amounting
on an average to £820 each (salaries from appointments
under Civil List)&mdash;these rich men who would, with one
accord, protest against the payment of members of the House
of Commons.  These were the rich men who were found
at public meetings denouncing members from Ireland as a
wretched crew, because, being mainly poor men, they received
enough to enable them to live from their constituents.
The peers were almost as careful of their relations as of
themselves.  In a valuable publication he saw it put down
that, from 1874 to 1886, no fewer than 7000 relatives of peers
had had places of emolument under the Government....
In the other House there were 120 Privy Councillors, of
whom he ventured to say the majority had never heard.
Orders had to be found for these gentlemen.  Almost every
one of them had a decoration.  There were three decorations
which were absolutely made for peers and for no other
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P241"></a>241}</span>
body&mdash;the Garter, the Order of St. Patrick, and the Thistle.
Walpole had declined a decoration 'because,' he said, 'why bribe
myself?'  Lord Melbourne said of the Garter that its pleasing
feature was that there was 'no nonsense of merit about
it.'  An impression existed that private Bill legislation was
more independent in the House of Lords than in that House.
He did not think it was....  No men looked better after
the class interests of those to whom they belonged than the
peers.  They were great landowners; 16,000,000 acres
belonged to them.  Yet our Land Laws were a disgrace to the
country and tainted with feudalism....  This House of
Lords was not collectively any worse than any six hundred
men would be.  They were <i>ex necessitate</i> a Tory House and
a House of partisans.  The assertion that they subordinated
public interests to their private class and party interests
was merely tantamount to saying that they were human
beings.  A House of Artisans would act on similar principles....
His amendment went to the root of the evil.  He at
first thought of including bishops, but he struck them out on
the principle of <i>de minimis non curat lex</i>.  If the hereditary
principle were done away with, what the honourable member
for Birmingham called 'the incestuous union between
the spiritual and the political world' would cease of itself.
His amendment would not prejudice the question of whether
there ought to be two Chambers or one only.  Personally
he was in favour of one, but those who voted with him need
not necessarily support him on that particular point.  Other
countries which had two had simply followed our example,
and it was a mere result of chance that we happened to have
two.  If they agreed, the second was useless; if they
disagreed, the second was pernicious.  If the functions of an
Upper Chamber were to be properly fulfilled by those who
soared above party and class interest, we must not look for
its members in this world, but we must bring down angels
from Heaven; but, as that would be difficult, there was one
other alternative.  The Conservatives at their meetings
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P242"></a>242}</span>
always shouted, 'Thank God we have a House of Lords!'  Radicals
had no intention to remain any longer supinely
like toads under the harrow of the House of Lords.  They
intended to agitate until they could say: 'Thank God we
have not an hereditary House of Lords!'"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Labouchere's amendment on that occasion was
defeated by a majority of 61 in a House of 385 members.
On November 21, 1884, Labouchere had moved the following
resolution: "That in view of the fact that the Conservative
party is able and has for many years been able, through its
permanent majority in the House of Lords, to alter, defeat,
or delay legislation, although that legislation has been
recommended by the responsible advisers of the Crown, and
approved by the nation through its elected representatives,
it is desirable to make such alterations in the relations of the
two Houses of Parliament as will effect a remedy to this
state of things."  Sir Wilfrid Lawson, in seconding the
resolution, said that he remembered a few years ago
Mr. Labouchere giving notice of a very similar resolution.  He
asked him if he thought a House could be made for it.
Mr. Labouchere had answered, "No, I do not think there will
be, for all the Radicals want to be made peers."  The member
for Northampton prophesied truly, for not forty members
could be got to come down.
</p>

<p>
With untiring patience, however, Mr. Labouchere moved
a resolution of the same nature almost every year that he
was in Parliament.  His perseverance on the subject was
only matched by the dogged persistence with which he
attacked the ridiculous appurtenances inseparable from the
upkeep of a constitutional monarchy.  When he was asked
by Captain Fred Burnaby once at Homburg why he was
always attacking the Royal family, who after all were well
meaning people, he replied: "One must find some very solid
institution to be able to attack it in comfort.  If the love
of royalty were not so firmly established in the middle-class
English breast, I should not dream of attacking it, for the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P243"></a>243}</span>
institution might topple over, and then what should I do?
I should have all the trouble of finding something else to
tilt against."
</p>

<p>
Another expression of his views on the Establishment is
found in his speech on Mr. Albert Grey's amendment on the
occasion of the Second Reading of the Church Patronage
Bill.  "From a Radical standpoint," he said, "it was
undesirable that there should be an Establishment at all, and
there seemed to be no reason why they should be continually
tinkering up and remedying this and that abuse in connection
with the Church....  He agreed with the Secretary of
State that this Bill did not go far enough, if it granted
compensation in the case of those who now held livings.  To sell
a cure of souls had always been regarded as a most monstrous
iniquity, and why should they give compensation to those
who were enjoying what was wrong?  They might as well
suggest that Simon Magus himself should have had
compensation.  There was another preposterous clause in the
Bill.  These advowsons could only be sold to the great
landlords and the lords of the manor.  If the livings were
sold at all, they should be sold to anybody who might be
ready to buy them.  But why should the great landlords&mdash;the
race he should be glad to see cleared off the land&mdash;why
should the great landlords and lords of the manor be allowed
to buy livings while other people were not? ... There
was no doubt that matters would be infinitely improved if
the parishioners had the right to veto the appointment of
clergymen.  But the amendment did not go far enough.
Why was there only to be a veto?  Why not allow the
parishioners to elect any clergyman they liked?  Why was
the bishop to be the only person to be allowed to have a veto?
If the majority of the people in a locality were dissenters,
he thought they should not be compelled to elect a Church
of England clergyman.  He was opposed to all this tinkering
of the Church of England, which should be disestablished
and disendowed....  He was quite ready to leave the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P244"></a>244}</span>
Church such amounts as had been given to it within the
last twenty years; but he had seen calculations made that,
deducting these amounts, a sum of about £5,000,000 per
annum ought to come to the public.  That sum was the
property not of a sect, but of the English people who paid
it, and he should like to see a Bill introduced dealing with
glebe lands.  These glebe lands were, he believed, the worst
cultivated in the country, and it would be infinitely better
to redistribute them in allotments amongst the deserving
labourers of the village than to leave them in the hands of
the clergymen.  When his honourable friend brought in a
Bill dealing with glebe lands, and giving back to them the
£5,000,000 of which they were now deprived for the benefit
of a sect, then he would give him his most cordial
support."  And so on.
</p>

<p>
In the June of 1884 he made one of his common-sense
speeches on the subject of the enfranchisement of women.
It occurred during the debate on the Representation of the
People Bill.  "It may be that we should enfranchise women,"
he said, "but because we have enfranchised men is no reason
that we should do so.  We may discuss the subject
eloquently, we may refer to Joan of Arc and Boadicea, but,
in point of fact, from the time of Eve till now there has been
a distinct difference between men and women.  There are
a great many things which I am ready to admit women can
do better than men, and there are other things which I think
men can do better than women.  Each have their separate
functions, and the question is whether the function of
electoral power is a function which women would adequately
discharge.  I do not think it is.  As yet I understand that
no country has really given women the vote; and were it
not that honourable gentlemen opposite, who are generally
averse to giving the franchise to any large body of men,
think, and think justly, that a very large majority of women
would vote for Conservatives, I should be surprised at their
making this desperate leap in the dark.  Some honourable
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P245"></a>245}</span>
members on this side of the House have told us that women
are better than men.  That is the language of poetry.  But
when we come to facts I am not at all disposed to admit that
women are better than men.  It is not a question of whether
women are angels or not, but whether they will make good
electors ...  the honourable member has told us that he
was convinced of this because Queen Anne was a great queen;
and he told us also that Elizabeth was a great queen.  But
Anne was not a great queen, and Elizabeth had the intellect
of a man with the weaknesses of a woman.  The honourable
member also spoke of Queen Christina of Sweden, but every
one knows that she was one of the most execrable queens
that ever lived, for, after being deposed by her subjects,
she went to Paris and murdered her secretary.  We learn
that, by the operation of nature, more women are born into
the world than men, that women live longer than men, and
that a considerable number of men leave the kingdom as
soldiers and sailors, while women remain at home.  In
consequence of this there are, at any given moment, a greater
number of women than men in the country.  I am told that
in every county, with the exception of Hampshire, more
women would be put on the register than men if we had
woman suffrage.  And what would be the consequence?  They
would look to the interests of women; they would band themselves
together, and we should have them, of course, asking to
be admitted to this House; and then, if they were admitted,
instead of being on an equality with them, we should put
ourselves under petticoat government; we should have women
opposite, women on these benches, and a woman perhaps in
the chair.  They would, of course, like women everywhere,
have their own way.  The honourable member had hesitated
as to whether he would give the vote to married women as
well as to unmarried women, and, by his mode of dealing
with the question, it would seem that he gave to vice what
he denied to virtue.  As long as a woman remains a spinster,
it appears that she is to have the vote, but that, so soon as
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P246"></a>246}</span>
she marries, she is to cease to be an elector; she is to lose
her rights if she enters into the holy and honourable state
of matrimony, and, if her husband dies, she is again to get
the vote.  When Napoleon was asked by Mme. de Stael
who was the best woman in the State, he said: 'Madame,
the woman who has the most children.'"
</p>

<p>
It will be seen from the above extract that his opinion
of the female sex was early Victorian, and so it remained to
the end of his life.  He was always a bitter opponent of
woman suffrage; and when, in 1896, a petition for the
Suffrage signed by 257,000 women from all parts of the United
Kingdom was exhibited, "by kind permission of the Home
Secretary," in Westminster Hall on a series of tables for the
inspection of members, he immediately called the attention
of the Speaker that afternoon in the House to the "unseemly
display," and insisted upon its removal.
</p>

<p>
He was indefatigable in his efforts to introduce economical
Radical finance into every detail of government, always
assuring his hearers that he was fighting for the principle
of economy, and not merely against the mere absurdity of
the existence of certain traditional offices and extravagances.
In 1885 we find him requesting the Attorney-General to do
his best to suppress the offices of Trainbearer, Pursebearer,
and Clerk of the Petty Bag.  He protested ably against the
large sums spent upon the upkeep of the royal yacht, and
upon the "objectionable practice" of asking the Commons
to vote a sum of money for special packets for conveyance
of distinguished persons to and from England.  He protested
against the nation being asked to pay the expenses
incurred in the ceremony of making the present King (then
Prince George of Wales) a Knight of the Garter.  He was,
in short, unceasingly vigilant wherever the spending of public
money was concerned, and his remarks were usually practical
and to the point.  A quotation from a letter he wrote to the
<i>Times</i> in the same year on the Graduated Income Tax will
be of interest, as peculiarly illustrative of his clear and simple
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P247"></a>247}</span>
view of the rights of the poor man versus those of the rich
man.  "The income tax," he wrote, "when first put on by
Mr. Pitt, was a graduated tax.  No one then regarded this
as a spoliation or confiscation.  That a rich man should pay
a higher percentage of taxation than a poor man is based
upon what Mr. Stuart Mill terms 'equality of sacrifice.'  It
will, I presume, he admitted by all that the first call upon
a man's income is that portion of it which is necessary for
him and his family to eat, to be clothed, and to secure some
sort of home.  If a man earns only £50 per annum, and has
an average family of two children, let me ask what remains
after this call has been met?  Nothing.  And if he has to
pay taxes, he and his family are obliged to go without a
sufficiency of clothing, or without a fitting home.  Now
look at the case of a man with £50,000 per annum, and with
a family of the same size.  He pays in taxation about 4½%
on his income&mdash;-let us say 5%.  This absorbs £2500.  He
may secure to himself and them not only all necessaries, but
all comforts, for £500 per annum.  Surely the sacrifice on
his part to the exigencies of the State of £7000 per annum
would not be so great a one as would be that of £2, 10s. per
annum by the man with an income of £50 per annum.  As
a matter of fact, however, the rich man pays at present
a maximum of 5%, and the poor man about twice that
percentage...."
</p>

<p>
He made a speech in the Radical Club at North Camberwell
on November 14, 1885, in which he once more resumed
his creed, and with it I must end this chapter, so as to proceed
with the history of the practice to which he put his theories.
"In the House of Commons," he said, "Radicals had hitherto
been in a very small minority, and were not appreciated,
and it was therefore gratifying to him as a strong Radical to
find what they did in the House of Commons was appreciated
by those who made the House of Commons.  For his
own part he was bound to say he could not form any clear
idea of what 'Conservative' meant now.  In the past, Conservatives
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P248"></a>248}</span>
were a party banded together to support the
landed interest, but Lord Randolph Churchill told them that
this was to be all forgotten, and that the Conservatives were
to become Tory Democrats.  These two words were utterly
antagonistic in themselves, and he could not understand
how men could be fish and fowl at the same time.  The only
principle which was guiding the Tories was to get into office
and remain there.  No reasonable man could become a
Conservative.  As for the Whigs they were more dangerous
than the Tories.  There were about thirty of them in the
House of Commons.  They rarely spoke, but their influence&mdash;a
backstair influence&mdash;was such that Ministers yielded to
them, and it was to them that the action in Egypt was due,
and they were the cause of the Crimes Bill in Ireland&mdash;both
of which had been steadfastly opposed by the Radicals in
Parliament.  It was easier to deal with an open enemy than
with a traitor in the camp.  Happily the Whigs were expiring,
and he did not think any one would care to adopt their
creed.  Coming to the Radical creed he said it was that
England should become a democracy, by which was meant
the rule of the people by the people and for the people.  He
was surprised statesmen could not see that the people would
use the power given them for their own advantage.  They
would insist on a Government not mixed, as now, with an
aristocratic element in it.  They would deal with the entire
Legislature, the Crown, the Lords, and the Commons; and,
if they were of his mind, they would go in for a much more
sweeping franchise.  The vote was a right and not a privilege,
and every man, not a criminal, ought to possess it,
or he was defrauded of his right.  He went in for residential
manhood suffrage, for free education, for which he would
apply the Church revenues and the misused charities.  He
was opposed to all indirect taxation, and advocated what
had been described as equality of sacrifice in general and
local taxation&mdash;that was, he would have a graduated income
tax, and, in no case, tax the necessaries of life.  In
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P249"></a>249}</span>
conclusion he said he hoped Mr. Chamberlain would succeed
Mr. Gladstone as Prime Minister, and as for the Whigs they were
welcome to go over to the Tories.  He would not refuse to
accept Lord Hartington, if he elected to fight under the
Radical party, but he would refuse to sink his own personal
opinions for any one."[<a id="chap10fn1text"></a><a href="#chap10fn1">1</a>]

CHAPTER XI
<br><br>
IN OPPOSITION
</h3>

<p class="t3">
(JUNE, 1885&mdash;DECEMBER, 1885)
</p>

<p>
Mr. Labouchere was not only a zealous friend and
advocate of the Irish members in Parliament, but a
variety of circumstances conspired with his own aptitudes
to constitute him an unofficial ambassador between conflicting
parties in the House, and, in particular, between the
Liberal Cabinet and the Nationalist leader.  "His real
influence," wrote Sir Henry Lucy recently, "was exercised
beyond the range of the Speaker's eye.  Nothing pleased
him more than being engaged in the lobby, the smoking-room,[<a id="chap11fn1text"></a><a href="#chap11fn1">1</a>]
or a remote corner of the corridors, working out some
little plot.  By conviction a thorough Radical, such was the
catholicity of his nature that he was on terms of personal
intimacy with leaders of every section of party, not
excepting those who sat on the Treasury Bench.  He was one of
the few men&mdash;perhaps the only man&mdash;whom Parnell treated
with an approach to confidence.  He watched the growth
of the Fourth Party with something like paternal interest.
Lord Randolph Churchill and he were inseparable.  In these
various episodes and connections he delighted to play the
part of the friendly broker."[<a id="chap11fn2text"></a><a href="#chap11fn2">2</a>]  In this way, far more
effectively than by formal speech or resolution, though here too
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P251"></a>251}</span>
he was untiring in the fight, he was able to use what is called
"the personal factor in politics."  And in his case the
personal factor was no light weight.  His extreme opinions,
in which he had never wavered since the days when, as a
young man, he had scornfully declined the succession to his
uncle's peerage, secured him the confidence both of the Irish
and of the left wing of the Liberals, while, by birth, education,
and habit of life, he was the welcome intimate of men who
sat on the other side of the House.  Eton, Trinity, and the
diplomatic service were an unusual training for an
ultra-Radical and gave an attractive flavour of sacrilege to his
views.  No one appreciated this circumstance more than
he did himself, and certainly no one could have put it out to
better interest.
</p>

<p>
On June 8, 1885, a coalition of Tories and Irish defeated
the Government by a majority of twelve.  The occasion
was an amendment moved by Sir Michael Hicks Beach
during the second reading of the Budget Bill, condemning
the increase of beer and spirit duties proposed by the
Chancellor of the Exchequer.  The combination between the
Opposition and the Irish was due to information having been
given by one of the Opposition leaders to the Irish party to
the effect that the Tories, if returned to power, would not
renew the Coercion Act, which would automatically expire
in the following August.[<a id="chap11fn3text"></a><a href="#chap11fn3">3</a>]  Mr. Gladstone resigned the next
day, and, after some delay, Lord Salisbury accepted office
and formed his first administration.  The new Viceroy, Lord
Carnarvon, following the precedents of Lord Mulgrave in
1837 and Lord Clarendon in 1850, himself made the declaration
of the Irish policy of the new Government.  That policy
was a complete renunciation of coercion.  Ireland was to
be governed by the ordinary law of the land.  "My Lords,
I do not believe that with honesty and single-mindedness of
purpose on one hand, and with the willingness of the Irish
people on the other, it is hopeless to look for some satisfactory
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P252"></a>252}</span>
solution of this terrible question.  My Lords, these I
believe to be the views and opinions of my colleagues."  The
"honesty and single-mindedness" of this piece of tactics
were severely criticised by Mr. Chamberlain.  "A strategic
movement of that kind executed in opposition to the notorious
convictions of the men who effected it, carried out for
party purposes and party purposes alone, is the most flagrant
instance of political dishonesty this country has ever known."
</p>

<p>
The Irish party were much impressed by the advances
of the Conservatives, and when Lord Carnarvon arranged to
meet Parnell in conversation on Irish affairs, in the course
of which they discussed whether "some plan of constituting
a Parliament in Dublin, short of the repeal of the Union,
might not be devised and prove acceptable to Ireland,"[<a id="chap11fn4text"></a><a href="#chap11fn4">4</a>]
Parnell may be excused for having thought that salvation
was to come from the Tories.  Mr. Gladstone had not yet
pronounced himself.  The Liberal Government had imprisoned
the Irish leader; its record in Ireland, with the exception
of the Arrears Bill, was summed up in the word coercion.
Liberal politicians were naturally upset at the new turn of
events.  Mr. Healy had written on May 25 to Mr. Labouchere
saying that "apart from coercion, it was the policy
of the Irish party to equalise all Liberals and Tories as much
as possible <i>pour nous faire valoir</i>, so that the matter will have
to be looked at by us apart from the renewal of coercion,
though of course, I imagine, if we thought we could trust
the Liberals to avoid obnoxious legislation and to stick to
reform, we should support them strongly.  But how can
we have any guarantee of the kind?"  Mr. Healy continues
further on in the letter: "I think a little time in the cool of
Opposition would do your party a world of good....  If
we supported your party next time, the Lords would throw
out or render worthless any Bill the Commons passed, and
time has proved that the Whigs won't face the Lords.  If
that institution were abolished we should be great fools not
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P253"></a>253}</span>
to be friendlier with the Liberals, but they are almost powerless
to help us, even if they were sincere, so long as the Lords
are all-powerful."  In a letter to Mr. Labouchere, dated
July 18, Mr. Chamberlain made the following significant
statement as to his feeling in the matter:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
The present attitude of the Irish leaders is not at all encouraging
to Radicals.  They take no account whatever of our difficulties
or of the extent to which we have, in the past, supported
Irish claims, and now that a Tory Government is in office they
are ready to accept from them with joy and gratitude the merest
crumbs of consolation, while they reject with scorn and contumely
the offers of further legislation which we have made.  I think,
under these circumstances, we must stand aside for the present.
The Irish Members "must stew in their juice" with the Tories
until they find out their mistake.  Whether the support of the
Radicals will still be forthcoming is a question.  My information
from the country satisfies me that further concessions to Irish
opinion are not at all popular even with our Radical constituents,
and, under all the circumstances, I am not unwilling to keep
silence for a time and await the course of events.
</p>

<p class="quote">
The Parnellites, as I understand, cannot count upon two
things:
</p>

<p class="quote">
First, on holding the balance after the next General Election.
I am convinced that they are mistaken, and we shall have a
majority over them and the Tories combined.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Secondly, they believe in the readiness of the Tories, under the
stress of party exigency, to make concessions to them in the shape
of Home Rule and otherwise, which even the Radicals are not
prepared to agree to.  In this, also, I am convinced they are
mistaken.  To whatever lengths Randolph Churchill may be
willing to go, his party will not follow him so far, and, sooner
or later, the Parnellites will find that they have been sold.
I believe the experience will be a healthy one for them and
for us.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The situation appealed strongly to Mr. Labouchere,
and he took up the part of the "friendly broker" with zest.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P254"></a>254}</span>
On July 22, he saw Mr. Healy and wrote the following
account of his interview to Mr. Chamberlain:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
Healy favoured me to his views during three hours to-day.
I told him that we were sure to win without the Irish, but that
if he and his friends wished for any sort of Home Rule, he must
understand that his only chance was to ally himself with the
Radicals and to support you.  I said that I had tried to impress
this upon Parnell, but that he talked rubbish about Grattan's
Parliament, and seemed to me to be thoroughly impractical.
Healy said that Parnell in his heart cared little for the Irish,
particularly since a mob ill-treated him in 1880.  He regretted to
be obliged to admit that personal feeling actuated his leader's
policy at times, but Parnell felt his dignity offended by his arrest
and his present feeling was revenge on Gladstone and Forster.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I suggested a rebellion.  But he said that this was impossible
because the present policy of all Irishmen was hanging together,
for they attributed all their troubles to divided councils.  He said
that Parnell is very astute.  He generally finds out which way
the feeling is amongst his followers before he suggests anything,
but, in one or two cases, he has put his foot down, when he
obtained his way.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I asked him about Davitt.  He laughed at the idea of his
being of any use to the Liberals.  He is a very difficult man, he
said, and a trouble to Parnell, who would like him to go against
us openly, for this would smash him; he cares neither for Tories
nor Radicals.  If Parnell joined the latter he would coquette
with the former and vice versa.
</p>

<p class="quote">
As regards the present situation he said that there never was
anything which could be called a treaty with the Conservatives,
but that there was an understanding that, if they helped the
Tories to turn out the late Government, and generally supported
them during the remainder of the Session, there was to be no
coercion.  "Churchill talks to us vaguely about Home Rule,
but we do not pay much attention to this.  We are now paying
our debt that we have incurred."  According to present arrangements,
the Party is to put out a manifesto calling upon all Irish
in England to vote solid for the Conservative candidates.  This
policy was adopted, he continued, in order to hold the balance.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P255"></a>255}</span>
I went into figures to show him that we should win without the
Irish, and said that the balance policy would only end in their
tying themselves to a corpse.
</p>

<p class="quote">
He admitted that this was possible, and said that personally
his sympathies were with the Radicals, but that it was impossible
to trust the Liberal party, and to hope that the Liberal party
could do anything even if they wished to, owing to the House of
Lords.  "No alliance," I said, "is worth anything which is not
based upon mutual interest.  We shall win at the election, but
we shall have to count with the Whigs.  The English electors
will be indignant at your conduct, and we shall naturally take
our revenge on you for your supporting the Tories.  Now, if you
would join us, we should be strong enough to hold our own against
Whigs and Tories.  We want your votes in the House of Commons;
you will find that you will do nothing without ours.  What
do you say to Chamberlain's scheme of Home Rule in the
<i>Fortnightly</i>?  He said: "... there are ... some things that I
object to in it, but Chamberlain could not carry it.  Even if he
got it through the House of Commons, the Lords would throw
it out."[<a id="chap11fn5text"></a><a href="#chap11fn5">5</a>]
</p>

<p class="quote">
Well, we went on discussing.  At last he said: "Can we have
any assurance that Chamberlain's scheme would be one on which
a Radical or Liberal Ministry would stand or fall?  Will
Gladstone declare for it?"  "What would you do if you could be
certain of a big scheme forming part of the Liberal platform?"
I asked.  "Our party really is guided by about six men.  What
we decide," he said, "the others accept.  I would propose that
we do not compromise ourselves with the Tories, that we should
issue no manifesto, leaving Irish electors to vote as they like.
When the plan is put forth in the next Parliament, we should
have to say that it does not go far enough, etc., but it might
merely be a dummy opposition.  Whether I could carry this I
don't know, but I think that I could." ... Finally he said that
he would be back at the commencement of August, and that, if
any arrangement could be made, he would do his best to further it.
</p>

<p class="quote">
There are two points in your scheme that he wants modified,
and these I will explain to you when I see you at the House, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P256"></a>256}</span>
you have a moment's spare time.  He told me to tell you that
those who wished that you should be ill received in Ireland would
not have their way, and that you may count on a perfectly
friendly reception.
</p>

<p class="quote">
This letter is long, but I thought that you would like to know
Healy's ideas, as he is by far the most honest and ablest of the
Irishmen....  It is all very well expecting to win the elections,
but the Irish vote is an important factor, and if only we could
square the eighty Irish in the House, and turn them into your
supporters, Whigs and Tories would be dished.  Certainly there
is no love lost between the Allies.  W. O'Brien, Healy told me,
declines to speak to any of them, regarding them as intriguers
with whom they are allied because of the Coercion Acts.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Mr. Healy wrote again to Mr. Labouchere on August
2, and his letter concluded with the following decisive
words: "Of course, however, I should be bound by the
majority, and would steadfastly carry out Parnell's policy,
whatever it is declared by the Party to be."
</p>

<p>
On August 11, Parliament was prorogued and politicians
soon began the campaign in the constituencies with a
view to the General Election, which was to take place in
November.  Lord Salisbury had made the first bid for the Irish
vote in a speech at the Mansion House on July 29, in which
he defended Carnarvon's policy as the logical outcome of the
Franchise Act of 1884.  On August 24, Parnell made a very
important speech at Dublin, in which he said that the Irish
platform would consist of one plank only&mdash;legislative
independence.  The English press was roused to vehement
denunciation.  The <i>Times</i> said that an Irish Parliament
was "impossible."  The <i>Standard</i> besought Whigs and Tories
"to present a firm uncompromising front to the rebel
chief."  The <i>Daily Telegraph</i> hoped that the House of Commons
would not be seduced or terrified into surrender.  The
<i>Manchester Guardian</i> declared that Englishmen would
"condemn or punish any party or any public man who
attempted to walk in the path traced by Mr. Parnell."
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P257"></a>257}</span>
The <i>Leeds Mercury</i> did not think the question of an Irish
Parliament worth discussing; while the <i>Daily News</i> felt that
Great Britain could only be saved from the tyranny of
Mr. Parnell by a "strong administration composed of advanced
Liberals."[<a id="chap11fn6text"></a><a href="#chap11fn6">6</a>]  The right wing of the Liberals, represented
by Lord Hartington, and the left by Mr. Chamberlain, both
protested.  Hartington, speaking on August 2, referred
to Parnell's manifesto as "so fatal and mischievous a
proposal."  Mr. Chamberlain, speaking at Warrington in
the early days of September, said very definitely: "Speaking
for myself, I say that if these and these alone are the terms
on which Mr. Parnell's support is to be obtained, I will not
enter into competition for it."  The veteran leader, for the
moment, was silent, having retired for repose and meditation
to Norway.  But though he said nothing himself, he
stimulated others to speak.  Mr. Barry O'Brien was
approached in August by a well-known English publicist, who
begged him to write some articles on the Irish question of a
"historical and dispassionate nature."  The publicist made
this request "at the suggestion of a great man&mdash;in fact a
very great man."  The very great man was Mr. Gladstone.
The first article was published in November under the title
of "Irish Wrongs and English Remedies."  On September
18 Mr. Gladstone issued the famous Hawarden Manifesto
admitting the necessity for Home Rule.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Labouchere was busy all the autumn trying to get
at the various shades of opinion prevalent among the Irish
members.  Michael Davitt was often a thorn in Parnell's
side, and the following letter he wrote to Mr. Labouchere
on October 9 is very interesting as indicating clearly the
way in which the two patriots often came into collision:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
There is a general impression among the rank and file of Irish
Nationalists that the G.O.M. will come nearest to Parnell's
demand.  There is no English statesman more admired by the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P258"></a>258}</span>
mass of the people, notwithstanding what <i>United Ireland</i> and
platform speakers may say to the contrary.  But the priests and
bishops would rather have the Tory party attempt the solution
of the Home Rule problem, owing to the fact of the Conservatives
being in favour of Denominational Education.  Men like Healy,
strange to say, are also pro-Tory in this respect, as they fear that
if Chamberlain and his party become dominant, the Radical or
democratic element in the Irish Nationalist movement will be
able to settle the Land question on more advanced lines than
those of the Parliamentary party.  In fact we have Tory
Nationalists and democratic Nationalists in our ranks, and the latter
would like to see men like Chamberlain, Morley, and yourself in
a position to arrange the Anglo-Irish difficulty.  Parnell's
attitude on Protection is absurd.  If we had a National Assembly in
Dublin to-morrow, he could not carry a measure in favour of
Protection.  Three-fourths of our people live by agriculture,
and these want to export their surplus produce, and would,
beyond doubt, be in favour of Free Trade.  Since Parnell's
Arklow speech I have more than once attacked Protection, and,
in his recent Wicklow pronouncement, he considerably modified
his views on the question.  How singular that the volunteers
in Grattan's time demanded Free Trade from England, and that

Have you read my suggestions about a possible <i>modus vivendi</i>
between England and Ireland in the concluding chapter of my
book?  Parnell took his One Chamber idea from it.  There is
no room for a Custom House in my simple plan, and the Irish
people would jump at such a scheme of self-government, while
every soldier now in Ireland might be removed without any
danger to the integrity of the Empire, if such a plan of settlement
were adopted....

No more vivid light can be thrown on Mr. Labouchere's
political activities at this period than is derived from his
letters.  He was in communication with all parties.  The
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P259"></a>259}</span>
following selection from his correspondence illustrates the
delicacy and importance of the negotiations with which he
was concerned.  The most interesting of these letters are
undoubtedly those exchanged between himself and
Mr. Chamberlain.  In them we see clearly enough what was the
main interest of Mr. Labouchere's life at this time.  I have
already pointed out how completely he subordinated all other
political questions to his wide-reaching plans for the
Radicalisation first of the Liberal party and secondly of the
country.  Irish or Egyptian or South African politics were
but pawns in his game.  In this correspondence we see how
that dominant interest came to be identified in his mind
with Mr. Chamberlain himself.  His frank admiration of
and political devotion to Mr. Chamberlain may be read
between the lines of all his letters.  A note that may almost
be called pathetic creeps into the later letters, when he has
realised at last that his glorious schemes are going to be
frustrated by the man on whom he had so completely relied
for their success.  The dramatic quality of some of the
letters is intense.  The angel wrestles with Jacob and knows
it is in vain.

DUBLIN, Oct. 15, 1885.
</p>

<p class="quote">
MY DEAR LABOUCHERE,&mdash;A number of us had a long chat
with Parnell on Saturday, and he seems quite confident that
whether Liberals or Tories get in, Home Rule will be granted.
I quite agree that, if the Tories get in with our votes and are
kept in by our help, they will come to terms, but I am not at all
so sure that if the Liberals get in they would have the courage
(even if they had the will&mdash;did we oppose them) to face the
question.
</p>

<p class="quote">
It is no use discussing our attitude from any other than the
expediency standpoint.  We have to make the best fight we
can for a small country, and clearly, if we could put the Tories
in and hold them dependent on us, that is our game.  With the
House of Lords behind them and our help, they could play ducks
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P260"></a>260}</span>
and drakes with the Union, were they so minded.  I confess,
however, I am so ignorant of the English campaign that I don't
find myself able to speculate on the outcome of the ballot box,
but I can hardly believe that there is much prospect of the
Liberals being beaten.  What you have not touched upon in
any letter to me is the point which always ghosts me&mdash;if the
Liberals bring in a bold scheme how will they overcome the House
of Lords?  You must remember that the Tories would then raise
the anti-Irish cry and the Lords would be in no unpopular
position in rejecting a scheme which they would allege meant
dismemberment.  Of course, if the Liberals then promised to
dissolve, it is hard to believe that with our support they would
not win, but it must be remembered that Liberals are not united
in our favour, and though Mr. Gladstone could keep them
together, yet men like Hartington and Harcourt would secretly
sympathise with the Tories, and would certainly not show
enthusiasm in rallying the constituencies on an Irish cry.  I don't
believe a bit in principle being of any account with English parties.
Look at the way Chamberlain spoke of Ireland when he was
baulked of coming over.  Read&mdash;to take a minor creature&mdash;Osborne
Morgan's speeches.  Mr. Gladstone is the only one who
has shown no bitterness and has kept the controversy in what
the Germans call the <i>heitern regionen wo die reinen formen wohnen</i>.
Of course I admit that we have given great cause for bitterness,
but I maintain that we could not have fought successfully in any
other style, whereas the English, with their bayonets to rely on,
need not grudge us Billingsgate&mdash;though certainly we have not
been allowed the exclusive use of this feeble weapon.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I was glad to read Childers' speech, which produced an
excellent impression here by its moderation and practicalness.
With regard to a plan, Parnell asked Sexton and myself to try
and draw up something, but we were so busy&mdash;that without a
good library, which we have not here, easily available, the task
is appalling.  Parnell's idea is to abolish the Lord Lieutenancy,
strike a financial balance between the two countries, giving, as
our Imperial quota, an average on ten years' returns of Irish
contributions with the cost of ruling Ireland deducted.  This
would get rid of the Irish Parliament voting or refusing supplies,
as the sum would be a fixed one, and if we did not pay it we could
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P261"></a>261}</span>
very easily be compelled.  He would be for retaining the Irish
members at Westminster, and I suppose there would not be
much trouble in the arrangement being made in that case, that
they should be summoned by the Speaker to debate affairs which
he declared Imperial or Irish, and in the English Legislature
taking them at a particular period of the Session for the sake of
convenience.  I think we should have full power over everything
here except the Army and the Navy, as I cannot see what other
interest England has here.  If we pay her a due taxation, what
possible care of hers is it how else we order our affairs?  As for
the minority, the Protestants would soon realise they were safe
with the Catholics (and they would be the pets of our people).
Let there be, by all means, every guarantee given for their
protection however.  If the Tories come in they would give us
Protection, I am sure, but would stipulate for terms for the
landlords.&mdash;Faithfully yours,

<p class="quote">
MY DEAR CHAMBERLAIN,&mdash;Just before the end of the Session
Herbert Gladstone came to me, and asked me to endeavour to
arrange some sort of <i>modus vivendi</i> with the Irish.  His father,
he said, required time, if any joint action was to be taken in the
next Parliament, to gain over the Whigs, and he was determined
not to lead unless he had a united party behind him.  I told
Herbert Gladstone that I was convinced that Parnell, for various
reasons, did not want an arrangement and that he would prefer
to remain an irreconcilable, but that it might be possible to
influence him through Healy and others.  So I sent to Healy,
who came over to England.  Healy explained that personally
he was strongly in favour of an arrangement, but that any one
going against Parnell would be nowhere just now, because the
Irish had got it into their heads that union was strength.  But
he promised to do all that he could.  Then I went abroad.  On
my return Herbert wrote to ask what had been done.  Healy
replied that a Committee consisting of Sexton, T. P. O'Connor,
etc., had been appointed to look into federations generally, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P262"></a>262}</span>
to report thereon, but that Parnell hardly spoke to his followers
upon political matters, beyond such as concerned the Irish
elections, and he went into various details as to what he thought
would prove satisfactory.  This letter I sent to Hawarden, and
got back a letter stating the views of the G.O.M., the phrase
being always "I" or "I think my father" as had been agreed.
The G.O.M. says that he is disposed to grant the fullest Home
Rule etc., but that he does not think it is desirable to formulate
a scheme before the elections, and he again presses for the Irish
minimum.  I have sent this to Healy.  Evidently the game of
the G.O.M. is to endeavour to unite the Party on Irish Legislation,
and to make that his <i>cheval de bataille</i>; but he says that he
will do nothing unless he can get some assurance that the Irish
will in the main back him up.  I don't think that they will, but,
with such strange creatures, there is no knowing.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I spent yesterday morning with our friend Randolph.  He
says that the Conservatives count upon 280 returns in their
favour, and that if they get anything like this they will not resign,
and they hope to remain in office for two or three years, owing
to the coalition between the Whigs, the Irish, and the Radicals.
He says that Hartington, who up to now has been very guarded
in his observations, now in private denounces you, and vows
that he will not stand it.  In his (Randolph's) opinion, he will
withdraw from politics.  If he does not, Randolph anticipates
that the outcome will be an Aberdeen Ministry.  Randolph
looks very ill, though he says that he is pretty well.  He is taking
digitalis for his heart, and says that he is certain that the late
hours in the House of Commons will knock him up....
</p>

<p class="quote">
What is the real feeling in the country I do not know, but I
have in the last fortnight attended some of the meetings of the
nonentities who are contesting the Metropolitan Constituencies,
and here you are first and the rest nowhere.  The Whigs seem
to have disappeared entirely.  My impression is that they have
all gone over to the Conservatives, and that the Whig leaders
are&mdash;if the country is to be judged by the metropolis&mdash;entirely
without followers.  When you allude to Goschen there are
groans, when you allude to Hartington there is silence; and you
have to get up a cheer for the G.O.M. by dwelling upon his
noble heart and that sort of trash.  I think, however, that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P263"></a>263}</span>
the Conservatives will gain more seats in London than we
anticipate.
</p>

<p class="quote">
By the way, I do not think that the alliance of Randolph
with the Irish is going on very smoothly.  He complained to me
that it was impossible to trust Parnell, and that the Maamtrasna
business had been sprung as a surprise.  Before the Conservatives
came in, Parnell told me that he would support the Conservatives
on no Coercion Bill, a scheme for buying out the landlords, and
money expended in further works.  No sooner were they in than
he told me that the feeling in Ireland was so strong for Home
Rule that it must be pushed forward.  My own experience of
Parnell is that he never makes a bargain without intending to
get out of it, and that he has either a natural love of treachery,
or considers that promises are not binding when made to a
Saxon....

Would it not be possible to have one grand Bill for local

<p class="quote">
MY DEAR LABOUCHERE,&mdash;Thanks for your most interesting
letter, which confirms my suspicions as to the intentions of our
great chief.  I was led to them in the first instance by the speeches
of H. G. at Leeds&mdash;he is generally inspired, I think.
Mr. G. himself was cautious with me at Hawarden, though he did not
conceal that his present interest was in the Irish question, and
he seemed to think that a policy for dealing with it might be
found which would unite us all and which would necessarily
throw into the background those minor points of difference about
the schools and small holdings which threaten to drive the Whigs
into the arms of the Tories or into retirement.  But I agree with
you that the <i>modus vivendi</i> cannot be found.  First, because all
Liberals are getting weary of making concessions to Parnell,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P264"></a>264}</span>
and will not stand much more of it, and secondly, because Parnell
cannot be depended on to keep any bargain.  I believe, therefore,
that Mr. G.'s plans will come to naught.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I hope Randolph Churchill is all out in his calculations.  I
do not give the Tories more than 200.  Of course the future
depends on the result of the Elections, but my impression is that
Hartington will yield, grumbling as usual, but still yielding.
</p>

<p class="quote">
The effect of the campaign I have just completed has surprised
me.  I really had no idea at first of giving more than a "friendly
lead" to candidates in the new constituencies.  The idiotic
opposition of the Whigs and the abuse of the Tories has turned
my gentle hint into a great national policy&mdash;and now it must be
forced on at all hazards.  The majority of new County candidates
are pledged to it&mdash;ditto Scotch members, ditto London.  In
Lancashire it is not so strong, as there are signs of rebellion in
the constituencies against the half-hearted orders of the local
Caucus.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I fear we cannot run English and Irish Local Government in
one Bill&mdash;the present conditions are so absolutely dissimilar&mdash;but
we will consider this again, if we have the opportunity.  I
am glad to say there is a good chance that Goschen will be
defeated at Edinburgh.  The working men are dead against him.
</p>

<p class="quote">
On the whole I am satisfied with the outlook.  The first
difficulty is to find fellow-workers: the rank and file are all right,
but there is an awful lack of Generals, and even of non-commissioned
officers.&mdash;Yours very truly,

MY DEAR CHAMBERLAIN,&mdash;I send you enclosed to look at.[<a id="chap11fn7text"></a><a href="#chap11fn7">7</a>]  I
have forwarded copy to Healy.  Evidently the G.O.M. is
getting a little anxious about the Election, and is now trying to
persuade the Parnellites that they must try and get pledges
from the Conservatives, because he knows that they cannot.
As he says, the Land question is the difficulty, because he is not
prepared to admit that its regulation in Ireland is involved in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P265"></a>265}</span>
Local Government, and that it in no way affects the integrity
of the Empire, whether land in Kilkenny belongs to this man or
that.  I have pointed out to Healy that the difficulty might
perhaps be turned by supporting your plan of compulsory purchase
by local authorities in both islands, and I have explained to him
the meaning of a fair price&mdash;viz. such an amount as would give
the landlord the same net income in consols or Government bonds,
as he gets now from his land, or ought to get, and I have urged
upon him that if such a Bill were passed, and if there were Home
Rule in Ireland, the Irish might surely make things so
uncomfortable to the landlords that they would be glad to clear out
for very little.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Would it not be a good plan to have one grand Bill, coupling
together local self-government here, and Home Rule in Ireland?
We should in that way get the Irish votes for England, and if the
portions of the Bill really do give substantial Home Rule in
Ireland, I greatly doubt whether the Irish would venture to vote
against the second reading.  They might develop their views
and swagger in Committee.  If this Bill were coupled with
another on your lines respecting land, the two questions could be
solved, or your purchase claims might form part of the Bill.  At
the bottom of the difficulty is the G.O.M.  He still hankers first
after the Whigs, and is not sound on the land question...,
and is bent upon that difficult task of making oil and water
combine.  Yours truly,

"It is very difficult for us to adopt a piecemeal policy,
although it certainly is the intention to issue instructions
that in regard to half a dozen Liberals, they shall be
supported at all hazards, but so far as I can gather the working
of Parnell's mind up to the present, it is not certain that he
will go against the Liberals bald-headed, if at all.
T. P. O'Connor is strong for supporting the Tories.  If we could
have an understanding with the leaders, it would settle this
and every other question.  It seems to me curious that we
are now to be asked to define our demands, on a question
on which English Statesmen do not need much instruction,
seeing that in 1881, when the agrarian question was
certainly complicated, nobody dreamed of asking our opinion,
but on the contrary the beauty of the measure was that it
was supposed to be disapproved by the Nationalists.  I
cannot, therefore, help feeling that this demand for a plan
from us is simply a desire for our discomfort, and the profit
of the English.  If there is really earnestness in the Liberal
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P267"></a>267}</span>
Party next Session (should they be in a majority) to settle
the Irish question, I do not think they will find us
unreasonable.  God knows it is time we were at peace, but if they
insist on forcing on us a Bill, which we denounce, and which
we shall wreck in the working, the contest between the two
countries will grow more aggravated than ever.  Spencer
and Forster were hit a thousand times more than Trevelyan,
and yet they never went pushing about, spitting gall as he
has done.  The G.O.M. is the father of them all, and I do
urge him to develop a little the lines of his first speech which

a Coalition Ministry&mdash;in fact the old game which had already

to this.  I want to find the people on our side, who

I should imagine that the Irish will come round.  The aim

If G.O.M. still hankers after an alliance with the Irish, it

here all the evening.

<p class="quote">
He says (but don't have it from me) that, if a vote of want of
confidence is not proposed, they will adjourn for three weeks
after the Speaker is chosen.  If they have a majority with the
Irish, he says that they are inclined to throw their Speaker as a
sop to the Irish, and evidently he has a scheme in his head to
get Hicks-Beach elected Speaker, and to take his place himself.
</p>

<p class="quote">
He told me that he had given in a memorandum to Lord
Salisbury about the state of parties in the House of Commons,
in which he puts down Hartington as worth 200 votes, and you
for the balance.  They intend to give a <i>non possumus</i> to all
proposals for Home Rule, and they expect to be supported by
Hartington, even if the G.O.M. goes for Home Rule.  Salisbury
is ready to resign the Premiership to Hartington if necessary,
and the new Party is to be called the "Coalition Party."  It
appears that the G.O.M. (but this I have vowed not to tell)
has given in to the Queen a scheme of Home Rule, with a sort of
Irish President at the head, who is to be deposed by the Queen
and Council, if necessary.

<p class="quote">
MY DEAR L.,&mdash;Thanks for your postings.  As far as I can
make out your party will be in a minority of 5 or 6 when all is
over a couple of days hence.  We shall have 86 in our party.
I have not seen Parnell for over a fortnight and know nothing
of his mind except that I think it significant he should have told
his interviewer that he expected Home Rule from the Liberals.
This, of course may have been a hint to prick up Salisbury, and
it remains to be seen how it will work.  But in my opinion we
have no course but to turn out the Tories.  Eighteen of their
men are Irish, who would oppose tooth and nail every concession
to us, and as they would vote against their own party on
H. R. (supposing "Barkis is willing") that would count 36 against
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P272"></a>272}</span>
them, which, of course, would hardly be made up to them by
Liberal votes, as your party, with three or four exceptions, would
stand coldly aside and rejoice to see them and us, combined, put in
a minority.  Looking at the matter in the most cynical manner,
therefore, I don't see what P. can do but put out the
Conservatives.  With us you would have such an immense majority
that you could spare the desertion of a score of rats amongst the
Whigs, while many of the Borough Conservatives who owe their
seats to us might abstain from a H. R. division.
</p>

<p class="quote">
As to the means of putting them out, I assume, if we were
agreed as to terms, that it would be easy to move an amendment
to the Address which we could support.  Whether this should
have relation directly to Ireland is a matter for the strategists
of your party to consider, as while it would suit our book
perfectly it might not rally all your men and might lead to
inconvenient debate.  It would, however, look odd in us, after
denouncing you so bitterly, to put you in straightway on some
by-issue, not in relation to self-government, and, moreover, as we
should be strictly "dark horses" as to which side we should
support, an Irish amendment would have the advantage of
extracting from ministers certain expressions or promises in order
to fetch us, which could be made great capital out of afterwards
by you.  Without having thought deeply on the strategical
aspect of the situation, it occurs to me that the best thing would
be to have an understanding with the Liberals and "play" the
Government for a few weeks with the Irish fly to see would it
rise, without actually landing them.  Both you and we would
then get time to see their programme and how their party
swallowed it&mdash;so as to corner them afterwards.
</p>

<p class="quote">
It is clear no scheme of Home Rule can be carried through the
Lords without a dissolution, and then, with our help, you could
have a majority of 200 over the Tories.  But we should have
a good registration of Voters' Bill passed first and some amendments
of the Ballot Act.  I think your people should at once get
into touch with Parnell.  He went to England this morning and
should be seen by some one from your side.  I agree with you
that Mr. Gladstone alone can settle the Irish question.  He is
the only man with head and heart for the task, and the only man
who can reduce to decency the contemptible cads who so largely
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P273"></a>273}</span>

I have replied that it is very questionable whether any sort

&mdash;would it not be well to use the G.O.M. to settle this question

agree long with his Whig friends.  So soon as the Irish question

MY DEAR L.,&mdash;Better try, would a letter to Parnell at 9
Palace Chambers, Westminster, find him, and ask him to make
an appointment with you.  There is no necessity to refer him
to the correspondence that has taken place, but tell what you feel
in a position to say on behalf of your party leaders.  He must
see that Gladstone must come in if we are to get anything, and
the only thing I see to be settled is the ritual to be observed in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P274"></a>274}</span>
bowing the Government out.  I presume he will move an amendment
to the Address, unless he has some satisfactory pledge from
Salisbury, which I don't believe, and I don't believe in the power
of Salisbury or anybody else to throw dust in Parnell's eyes.
"Hard cash"[<a id="chap11fn11text"></a><a href="#chap11fn11">11</a>] or a Catholic University won't bait the Tory hook
for us to swallow.  I'm for the whole hog or none.  I think it
would be important if we could have some understanding as to
the procedure, we, in the opinion of your leaders, should adopt
as to the terms of an amendment to the Address.  They might
prefer it should be one they could speak on and not support, or
both support and speak on.  The latter seems most convenient
in case it is thought better to turn the Government out immediately,
so as to allow of the re-election of the new Ministers.  My
view, however, is (and it is not a strong one, because I have not
heard the arguments contra) that it would be better to keep the
Tories in a little for the reasons previously given, and also for
the additional one that once they accept our help they will all
be tarred with the Irish brush, and cannot afterwards complain
of your party accepting an alliance by which they are not ashamed
to profit.  "Sour Grapes" would then be a complete answer to
them in opposition.

The <i>Pall Mall</i> of yesterday was directly inspired from
Hawarden.  The channel was Norman.  Certainly the ways of
Mr. Gladstone are rather more mysterious than those of the Heathen
Chinee.  My reading of it is that he is simply insane to come
in....  The Irish are suspicious of him, and intend to have things
clear before they support him.  Parnell says that he has a way of
getting people to agree with him by the enunciation of generalities,
but that when he has got what he wants, his general principles
are not carried out as might have been anticipated.  This is so
true that I could not deny myself the pleasure of letting him know
it.  In this case, he will have to be a good deal more definite, if
he is to count on the Irish.

My own conviction is that if the Irish get Home Rule, they

... Now I have a great deal to tell you.  Labouchere came
to see me this morning.  He asked me our intentions.  I gave
him the following information.  I can rely upon him:
</p>

<p class="quote">
(l) That there would be no motion for adjournment after
the 12th, but that business would be immediately proceeded
with after three or four days' swearing.  On this he said that,
if we liked to go out on a motion for adjournment, he thought the
other side might accommodate us.  I told him that such an
ineffably silly idea had never entered our heads.  Then he told
me that he had been asked whether he could ascertain if a certain
statement as to a Tory Home Rule measure which appeared
recently in the <i>Dublin Daily Express</i> was Ashbourne's measure,
and if the Tories meant to say "Aye" or "No" to Home Rule;
to which I replied that it had never crossed the mind of any
member of the Government to dream even of departing from an
absolute unqualified "No," and that all statements as to
Ashbourne's plan were merely the folly of the <i>Daily News</i>.  Then I
was very much upset, for he proceeded to tell me that, on Sunday
week last, Lord Carnarvon had met Justin M'Carthy, and had
confided to him that he was in favour of Home Rule in some
shape, but that his colleagues and his party were not ready, and
asked whether Justin M'Carthy's party would agree to an enquiry,
which he thought there was a chance of the Government agreeing
to, and which would educate his colleagues and his party if
granted and carried through.  I was consternated, but replied
that such a statement was an obvious lie; but, between ourselves,
I fear it is not&mdash;perhaps not even an exaggeration or a
misrepresentation.  Justin M'Carthy is on the staff of the <i>Daily News</i>.
Labouchere is one of the proprietors, and I cannot imagine any
motive for his inventing such a statement.  If it is true, Lord
Carnarvon has played the devil.  Then I told Labouchere that
if the G.O.M. announced any Home Rule project, or indicated
any such project and, by so doing, placed the Government in a
minority, resignation was not the only course; but that there was
another alternative which might even be announced in debate,
and the announcement of which might complete the squandering
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P280"></a>280}</span>
of the Liberal party, and that his friend at Hawarden had better
not omit altogether that card from his calculations as to his
opponents' hands.  Lastly, I communicated to him that, even
if the Government went out and Gladstone introduced a Home
Rule Bill, I should not hesitate, if other circumstances were
favourable, to agitate Ulster even to resistance beyond constitutional
limits; that Lancashire would follow Ulster, and would
lead England; and that he was at liberty to communicate this
fact to the G.O.M.[<a id="chap11fn13text"></a><a href="#chap11fn13">13</a>]

and say that obviously he intends to propose Home Rule.  If so,
adverse vote will be followed by dissolution.  Will they dare to
do this?  Churchill says that they will, and that I might privately
tell Mr. Gladstone this.

<p class="quote">
MY DEAR CHAMBERLAIN,&mdash;Has this occurred to you?  The
Whigs evidently will not stand Mr. Gladstone's proposals.  If
you therefore were to rally to them, you would clear the nest of
these nuisances, and, as Mr. Gladstone cannot last very long,
become the leader of the Opposition or of the Government&mdash;a
consummation that we all want.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I think that the Customs matter would not be a <i>sine qua non</i>.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Imperial matters would be few.  We are against wars.  The
main Imperial question would be for extra money&mdash;in case of
wars.  In the main the Irish would be with us&mdash;their views about
land are much yours&mdash;I should fancy therefore that, provided we
have a clear distinction between local and imperial affairs, we
should soon be the very best of friends.
</p>

<p class="quote">
That Mr. Gladstone will go on, I think pretty certain,
because&mdash;excellent and good man as he is&mdash;he sees that his only
chance is, to get the Irish.  He is now engaged in a game of
dodging.  He has invented as usual a "principle"&mdash;that he can
go into no details until he officially knows that the Government
will do nothing.  The object is to get the Irish on generalities.
They, however, are quite up to this, and even supposing that they
were to vote with us, they would at once turn him out, if he were
to play pranks.  I do not quite therefore see how he could come
in without some sort of secret understanding with them.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Now, what would satisfy them?
</p>

<p class="quote">
On customs, as I have said, there would be no great difficulty.
</p>

<p class="quote">

</p>

<p class="quote">

</p>

<p class="quote">

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P282"></a>282}</span>

<p class="quote">
A King Log in the person of a Member of the Royal Family.
The veto to be exercised by King Log with the consent of his

<p class="quote">
The Privy Council to be entirely reorganised, or the present

<p class="quote">
Things would then work out by some of the Irish Ministers
being made Privy Councillors.
</p>

</p>

<p class="quote">
Now, with such a plan, with nominated Members for five

they snap at nominated Members, although they may perhaps

very much in your hands, for to get into power, I really believe
that he would not only give up Ireland, but Mrs. Gladstone and

Churchill is going to Ireland.  It is an old promise, he says,

DUBLIN, Dec. 23, 1885.
</p>

<p class="quote">
MY DEAR L.,&mdash;Thanks for your views.  If Churchill and his
lot want to stay in, in order to thwart us and Mr. Gladstone, then
I say, by all means, let them have a few months office, and let us
give them&mdash;well&mdash;purgatory for a bit and see how they take
it.  It seems to me that opinion is not quite ripe enough yet
amongst your party to swallow strong meat.  I therefore think
a while in the cold would teach them whether Mr. Gladstone was
wiser than the tuppence ha-penny intelligence of his rank and
file.  What the God-fearing Radical evidently wants is a course
of Tory slaughter abroad, and sixpence on the income tax, and
we are just the boys to help them to it.  Opinion here in loyalist
circles seems to take it for granted that Gladstone needs a check
from his own party, and I confess it has somewhat the aspect of
it.  So it seems to me we shall have to turn round and "educate"
the Liberal party, since they won't allow the greatest man they
ever had to do so.  A pretty mess they will be in, unless they
seize this opportunity under his leadership of consolidating
their party.  I should like to know what would become of them
without Gladstone?  You would have Chamberlain and Hartington
cutting each other's throats and the Tories standing
laughing by, profiting by your divisions!  And what should we
be doing?  You may be sure whatever was worst for the Liberal
party.  You may dissolve fifty times, but until you dissolve
us out of existence, there we'll be, a thorn&mdash;aye, a bayonet in
your sides.  Here we were with the chance of getting all Ireland
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P284"></a>284}</span>
round to some moderate scheme that would end for ever the feud
between the two countries, and now it appears that some gentlemen
who were born yesterday, and couldn't tell the difference
between a Moonlighter and an Orangeman, propose to spoil the
whole thing&mdash;and in the interest of the "Empire" forsooth.  I
venture to think that the statesman who had the boldness to
think out some proposition for the pacification of this island&mdash;small
as it is&mdash;is the best friend the Empire has had for many a
long day!  My heart is sick when I read the extracts telegraphed
from the English papers to think these are the idiots we have to
deal with and to argue with.  It is almost a justification of
O'Donovan Rossa.  They have Moses and the Prophets, but
they want a sign from Heaven.  Of course, I know there are
ten thousand difficult details to be settled, but these men don't
want to settle anything.  They have some party dodge to serve,
and Ireland is their happy hunting ground.  Let them take care
that the quarrel is not a poisoned morsel for their dogs.  Churchill
babbles of coming over to rouse the Orangemen!  <i>Je lui promets
des emotions</i>.  He had better bring Gorst with him to rally the
"re-actionary Ulster members."  If these men think as well
as talk this blague, England is very lucky in her rulers.
</p>

<p class="quote">
But to quit apostrophe (which you must pardon) what are
we to do?  Can we expect Mr. Gladstone to bear the battle on
his single shield?  Is it not plain that if we plunge into Home
Rule plans just now before your intelligent public apply their
enlightened minds to it we shall get far less than what we should
get by waiting and worrying you for a few years?  We are all
young, and though British saws won't bear me out, you are a
very fickle and unstable people, while ours has the tenacity of
700 years to carry us through.  We can wait awhile and see who
gets the worst of it, and if we are beaten in our time&mdash;well, there
are plenty of young men and young women in Ireland to breed
future difficulties for you.  Some of us thought as Nationalists
we were making a great sacrifice in being willing to give up our
ideals, but the spirit in which we are met shows how much our
surrender is appreciated by the individuals who subscribed for
cartridges for the Hungarians, Italians, and Poles.  The curse
of being the sport of your two parties is in itself the best argument
for the necessity of Home Rule.

<p class="quote">
As for Churchill, a great deal of what he told you I take to
be bluff&mdash;told for the purposes of intimidation.  I don't believe
they'd dissolve, and if they are so inclined we ought not to give
them the chance but help them over the stile, in order to trip
them up at some better opportunity.  When we beat them a few
times, say on their estimates, and worry them on adjournments
and motions, they will be in a much less heroic mood than they
are now.  Slow poison is a better medicine for them than the
happy dispatch!  By hanging on their skirts for a few weeks,
snubbing them and humiliating them at every opportunity, they
will be in a much more reasonable frame of mind than they are
now, and meantime perhaps your young lions could be reduced
to reason and your old ones have their claws trimmed.  It is no
good talking about the details of Home Rule, when the very
mention of the word gives half the Liberal party the shivers.
The men that won't take Mr. Gladstone for a leader to-day will
have to take Mr. Parnell to-morrow, for assuredly things cannot
rest as they are.  Mr. Gladstone's enemies just now are England's
and Ireland's worst enemies also.  He alone can settle the question
moderately and satisfactorily, yet he is assailed by his own
party as if he were some reckless junior acting not from the
ripeness of knowledge and sagacity, but through some adolescent's
lust of untasted power!  Your party ought to get up an
altar to Mundella and put his long nose in the tabernacle.  It is
sweet to know that he has controlled the education of British
youth.

would be very unpopular and indeed unjustifiable, unless the

proposal.  But it is clear he will be left in the lurch, if he

therefore that Gladstone could use the views of others to head
off Parnell.  Now as I believe we should speak with one voice
and chime the same note, I don't think it would be well for me to
say anything at present beyond thanking you for all your
kindness.  I mean anything to any one but yourself.  Harcourt's
views quite interest me, and he is quite right, for if our people
are disappointed after the visions held out to them, they cannot
be held in.  This country could easily be made ungovernable so
far as the collection of rent or legal process is concerned, and the
obstructors would find they were not dealing with playboys but
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P290"></a>290}</span>

I can hardly believe the Tories would dissolve if your party

If a big vote goes against them it will knock the bottom out of

them, they must count the cost.  Defeat would mean the instant
carrying of any schemes Gladstone liked to put forward and no
nonsense from the Lords.  The Peers could not reject it, and if
they did and Gladstone threatened to dissolve against their
existence&mdash;<i>bon soir</i>!  I am firmer therefore in my opinion that

they should govern England as it is to ours that they should

to the English is his best justification in our minds.  Chamberlain's
point about whether the Imperial Ministry which enjoyed
the confidence of the English on Home affairs should resign if

SIR,&mdash;During the last Parliament I voted frequently with the
Irish members against the Government.  I did so because I was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P291"></a>291}</span>
opposed to exceptional measures of coercion, and believed that the
remedy for Irish wrongs consisted in allowing Ireland to manage
her own affairs, subject to full guarantee being given for the
maintenance of the integrity of the Empire.  In this view it would
appear that I was only in advance by a year or two of the opinions
of many Liberals and Radicals and of some Conservatives.

Owing to the course of action which I pursued, I was thrown
into personal and friendly relations with many of the Irish and

First, however, I will say with your permission a word
respecting Irish opinion, and the position, so far as I can judge it,
of the Irish political leaders.  Among those of them opposed to
the present state of things the majority are not separatists, some
because they are in favour of the Union with the British Isles,
others because they are aware that separation is practically
impossible.  Those who aspire to separation are an infinitesimal
minority, and they subordinate their opinions to those of their
colleagues.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Throughout Ireland a passionate desire for Home Rule is
entertained by all with the exception of the landlords, the
officials, and the Orangemen.  A good many of the landlords
are disposed, however, to rally to it, while the area over which
the Orangemen hold sway is growing smaller and smaller every
year.  Many of the Presbyterians of Ulster have already thrown
in their lot with the Home Rulers.  There is now but one single
northern Irish county left which does not return a
Parnellite&mdash;viz. Antrim.  In four Ulster counties&mdash;Monaghan, Cavan,
Donegal, and Fermanaugh&mdash;no one but Parnellites have been chosen.
The desire for Home Rule is irrespective of any wish to alter
the land system, although this wish is an important factor in
Irish feeling.  Agriculture is almost the only industry in Ireland,
and one reason why the landlords are disliked is that, with some
few exceptions, they have set themselves in antagonism to the
aspirations of the nation for Home Rule.  The Land Act has
disappointed and dissatisfied every one, for, while the landlords
declare that their property has been confiscated, the farmers cry
out that their property&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> their improvements, have been
handed over to be rented for the landlords' benefit in the teeth
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P292"></a>292}</span>
of the Healy clause.  It is hopeless to suppose that an Imperial
Parliament, composed of a majority of gentlemen, who know very
little about the real merits of the case, can settle this great
question, at which it has been tinkering for generations, and I, as an
Englishman, object to have my time taken up in discussing it
any more, and trying to accommodate the differences between
Irish renters and Irish rentees.  Mr. Chamberlain has rightly
objected to the Imperial Exchequer being saddled with purchase
money to be paid to the landlords, and I think our duty to them
would be performed if we were to insist, in any settlement of the
Irish question, that they shall be entitled to call on the Irish
treasury for a fair price for their estates whenever they want
to sell them, due regard being had to the tenants' statutably
recognised ownership of his improvements.  Thus the landlords,
if they object to live in an island, the inhabitants of which enjoy
the advantage of self-government, would be able to leave it with
the equivalent for their land in their pockets in hard cash.
With their departure the police difficulty would disappear, and
with it the necessity of England paying £1,500,000 per annum
for the Royal Irish Constabulary, although the Irish insist that
they only require a force of ¼ this size, and are willing to pay
for it themselves.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Speaking generally, and if the land system were satisfactorily
settled, it may be said that the Irish are not Radicals in one sense
of the word.  Their habit of thought is Conservative.  They are,
like the French, somewhat too inclined to look and state
interference in everything.  Their tendency is, as M. Guizot said of
the French, to fall into a division between administrators and
administered.  Their hostility to law is not to law abstractedly,
but to the law as presenting what they regard as an alien
ascendency.  I am inclined to think that, had they a Parliament
of their own, they would surprise us by their Conservative
legislation.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Apart from the Nationalists, who form the great bulk of the
nation, are the Fenians.  They are comparatively speaking few
in number.  Their strength consists in being able to tell the
Irish that Home Rule never will be granted, and that Ireland
must either separate from us, or be ruled by us in local as well
as in Imperial affairs.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P293"></a>293}</span>
</p>

<p class="quote">
That the Nationalists have to a certain extent acted with the
Fenians is true.  But could they do otherwise?  They had to
fight against a common opponent.  Between a Nationalist and
a Fenian there is as much difference as between the most moderate
Whig Squire who sat in last Parliament on the Liberal benches
and me.  Yet we both voted frequently together against the
Conservatives.  The Nationalists are the Girondists, the Fenians
are the Jacobins.  Like the Girondists they make common cause
against a common enemy.  (<i>He carries on this simile lengthily.</i>)
Mr. Parnell and his political friends have substituted constitutional
agitation for lawless and revolutionary agitation.  He has
only succeeded in this by persuading his countrymen that his
action will result in success.  If he be doomed to failure, the
Fenians will once more gain the upper hand in Ireland.
</p>

<p class="quote">
The <i>Times</i> has more than once suggested that the Irish
Parliamentary party should state precisely what they want.  They
want a Parliament.  How possibly can they be expected to say
officially to what limitations and to what restrictions they would
submit for the sake of a definite settlement before some responsible
English statesman, with a strong following at his back, is
prepared to give them a Parliament?  They would indeed be
fools were they to make such a tactical blunder.  In any negotiation
of which I have ever read, bases are agreed on before either
party&mdash;and certainly before the weaker party&mdash;specifies details.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I think, however, I am not far wrong in saying the following
scheme would be accepted:
</p>

<p class="quote">
1. Representation in the Imperial Parliament upon Imperial
matters alone.  This would require a hard and fast definition as
to what is Imperial and what is local, together with, as in the
United States, some legal tribunal of appeal.
</p>

<p class="quote">
The Army, the Navy, the protection of the British Isles, and
the commercial and political relations with foreign nations would
be regarded as Imperial matters, and probably there would be
no insuperable difficulty&mdash;if it were deemed expedient&mdash;in
arranging a Customs Union, such as that of the German Zollverein
before the German Empire came into existence, leaving it to the
Irish to foster their industries, if they please, by means of
bounties.  There would be an Imperial budget, which would be
submitted each year to the Imperial Parliament with the Irish
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P294"></a>294}</span>
sitting in it.  Each country would contribute its quota according
to population and property.  If more were required, the
proportions would be maintained.  Each island would raise its
quota as it best pleased.
</p>

<p class="quote">
2. The Government of Ireland&mdash;a Viceroy, a Privy Council,
a Representative Assembly, Ministers.
</p>

<p class="quote">
(1) The Viceroy&mdash;a member of the Royal family, with a
salary of £25,000 per annum.
</p>

<p class="quote">
(2) The Privy Council.&mdash;The present Privy Council consists
of about fifty individuals, all of them anti-Nationalists, and some
of them virulently so.  The Council would have to be reorganised.
This might be done by nominating 100 new Councillors,
men of moderate views, but who would frankly accept the
arrangement and endeavour to give practical effect to it.  The
Council would gradually be increased by the admission of the
Irish Ministers.
</p>

<p class="quote">
(3) House of Representatives.&mdash;Its members would be elected
as with us according to population.  As a concession, however,
it would be agreed that one-fourth of the members might be
nominated, either during two Parliaments or for five years.
</p>

<p class="quote">
(4) Ministers.&mdash;They would be selected from the Parliamentary
majority as with us.  The Viceroy would call upon the
leader of the majority to form a Cabinet.  He would, however,
retain the constitutional right of the Queen to dissolve.
</p>

<p class="quote">
3. The Veto.&mdash;This would be reserved to the Viceroy, with
the consent of his Privy Council.  Of one thing I am absolutely
certain.  It is that no arrangement is possible which would give
the veto to the Imperial Parliament.  The Irish object to this,
because they consider that it would convert their assembly into
a mere debating Society.  We&mdash;although we seem just now
enamoured with it&mdash;should soon find that all legislation in
England would soon be brought again to a standstill, as we should
be perpetually debating Irish bills.  The Irish would also object
to the Queen exercising the veto by the advice of her Council,
for, practically, this would mean the veto of those representing
the majority in the English Parliament.  The Privy Council is,
unfortunately, historically odious in Ireland.  But were it recast,
it is probable that the Irish would not object to the Veto which
I have suggested.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P295"></a>295}</span>
</p>

<p class="quote">
4. Protection of Minorities.&mdash;They would already be
protected by the veto, by the nominated members and by the
Orangemen, who would return a considerable contingent; but
the Irish would go even further than this.
</p>

<p class="quote">
(1) No contract existing or entered into could be set aside by
Irish legislation.  In the event of any one feeling himself
aggrieved in this matter, he might appeal to the Judicial Committee
of the House of Lords.
</p>

<p class="quote">
(2) Any Landlord would have the right to insist upon his
land being bought by the Irish state on the estimate of its value,
by the Land Judges, due consideration being taken of tenants'
improvements.
</p>

<p class="quote">
5. The Army in Ireland and the Fortresses would be under
the orders of the Imperial Ministry, much as is the case in the
United States of America.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I am far from saying that the Irish, if left to draw up the
settlement, would insert these conditions.  Many of them savour
of tutelage and distrust.  But I am pretty certain that, although
in discussion they might claim more, they would, if they could
not get more, accept this scheme with an honest intention
to make it workable.  Less they would not accept, and for a
very good reason.  If their leaders are to be responsible for
the peace, tranquillity, and prosperity of Ireland, they must have
full powers to act, and the scheme of Government must in
the main be acceptable to the majority of the governed.
</p>

<p class="quote">
At present we have arrived at a Parliamentary deadlock.
No measure dealing with Ireland can be passed in the existing
House of Commons without the aid of the Irish contingent.  If
a Coalition Government were to succeed in passing, either in
this Parliament or a subsequent Parliament, a half-hearted
measure, the Irish would decline to accept it.  They would
simply refuse to act on it, and thus confusion would become worse
confounded.  Experience has proved that any proposal not to
count on the Irish vote is outside the area of practical politics.
Experience has also shown that the rival political parties will
not subordinate their differences to any anti-Irish policy.  Such
schemes are like the kiss of peace of the French Assembly
during the French Revolution.  They sound all very well but
last about half an hour.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P296"></a>296}</span>
</p>

<p class="quote">
We have then to decide whether we will try the experiment
of federalisation under the restrictions for the unity
of the Empire, and the protection of the minority in Ireland
such as I have roughly indicated; or whether we will embark
in a career of what practically amounts to war between the two
islands.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Many Conservatives are excellent citizens, others are party
men.  The latter would probably not object to the latter
alternative.  It would unquestionably have the effect of the French
wars in the days of George III.  They, I fully admit, would be
better able to carry out a system of repression than the Radicals.
They therefore would in the main hold office.  Domestic reforms
would be neglected, the Radical chariot would stand still.  You,
Sir, I apprehend, are not a Radical, and though you may not be
influenced by this arrest of the chariot, you would not regret
the <i>propter hoc</i>.  But it ought to lead any Radical to pause and
reflect.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I did not show myself a fanatical worshipper of Mr. Gladstone
during the last Parliament, in fact I must have voted
against him as often as I voted for him.  In my address to my
constituents I said that I should raise my voice against any
Administration, no matter what it be called, that lags on the
path of progress or that falls into error.  My constituents
have been good enough to leave it to me to decide what is
lagging and what is error.  If the Conservatives will at once
bring in a Bill dealing with Ireland in the manner I have
indicated they shall have my vote as far as that Bill is
concerned.  But I gather that they have determined to oppose a
<i>non possumus</i> to all such demands and not to go beyond
including Irish in any general scheme for local Government in
both islands.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I turn therefore to Mr. Gladstone.  His public utterances
lead me to believe that he is prepared to sacrifice his well-earned
ease, and to endeavour to settle the question in a manner satisfactory
to us and to the Irish.  His experience is vast, his patriotism
is undoubted, his tactical skill is unrivalled.  I would suggest
therefore that we should give him full powers to treat for us with
the Irish, and that we should support him in any arrangement
which meets with his sanction.  The Irish have always had a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P297"></a>297}</span>
sneaking affection for him; they will recognise that he has to
count with English public opinion, and they will concede far
more to him than to any other negotiator that we might select.
I have seen that Lord Hartington and Mr. Forster have
pronounced against Home Rule, and that the former is negotiating
with Mr. Goschen.  Lord Hartington generally pronounces
against a measure as a preliminary to accepting it; I do not
therefore ascribe much importance to his declaration.
Mr. Forster, during the last Parliament, distinguished himself by
uttering, in season and out of season, gibes and sarcasms against
his former colleagues.  Mr. Goschen, a man of great ability and
honesty, could not find one English Liberal Constituency to
return him, and sits in Parliament by the good favour of the
Edinburgh Conservatives.  With all respect therefore to the
two gentlemen, I hardly think that the Liberals will accept a
policy from them.  If we are to judge by what happened in the
last Parliament they have no followers....  Let Mr. Gladstone
then boldly declare himself for a well considered measure of
Home Rule....

I should say myself that it would be far better not to have the
Irish at Westminster at all; this would meet the conundrum of
an Imperial and an English Ministry.  As a statistical fact,
Ireland does not now contribute much more than the cost of her
civil Government to the Imperial Exchequer.  Let her contribute
nothing, or some fixed sum for armaments (which she probably
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P301"></a>301}</span>
would not pay).  She would be like the Dominion.  We should
hold the country through the army and the fortresses, and
if she tried to separate, we should suspend the Constitution.
But as a matter of fact, she would not try.  The Irish "idea of
patriotism is to serve the country at a good salary, and to
get places for cousins, etc.  You would see that Irish politics

MY DEAR L.,&mdash;I have been in the country holidaying.  The
statistics you want I think could be got from Col. Nolan's return,
which alas shows that you profit £3,000,000 per annum out of
us.  I speak from memory.  Go to Smith in the House of
Commons' Library, and ask him to find it out for you.  He can get
you this and any other statistical facts you need.  But some
thirty years ago your people dropped showing a separate Irish
account and bulked the whole thing in order to diddle us, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P302"></a>302}</span>
therefore it is net easy to reckon the figures out.  O'Neill Daunt,
however, can supply everything you can't get elsewhere.  I think
Randolph must have pulled the longbow rather taut to you in
every way.  I don't believe anything he has been saying.  As
to Chamberlain he must be crazy to write that way to Morley.
Give the G.O.M. power and he could form a Cabinet in a week
minus Joe, and the Gates of Birmingham should not prevail
against it (it is "Hell" in the original).  Your letter ought to do
much good.  You greatly improved it.  It has been quoted into
all the Irish papers and commented on.  I am glad it appeared,
but of course, I know nothing of the genesis.  I agree with you
about representation in the Imperial Parliament.  Your people
seem to shy at it, and it would be better for us not to have it,
unless your side insists.  Still there will be many Irishmen loath
to surrender all representation, but they cannot have everything.
I don't think Fottrell can physic Chamberlain's disease.  He's
going to be a Mugwump.  I wish him joy of the profession.  His
chance was to be first Lieutenant to the G.O.M. <i>cum jure suc</i>,

of Sorehead.  I note what you say about our papers.  Like
Brer Rabbit we ought to "lay low" just now.  Small wonder
if Gladstone should be intimidated into minimising coercion.
The Heathen rage very furiously against him.  I mistrust
Grosvenor's influence on Hawarden.  If the old man was ten
years younger, I'd be for keeping in the Tories till we got County
Boards out of them in order to chasten your party in the cold
winds of opposition.  Our people won't have any fraud of a Bill
made for the Whigs to swallow.  We shall be reasonable, but
so must your party.  We can wait, for we are used to it.  Your
party leaders represent personal ambition, and are in more of a
hurry.&mdash;Faithfully yours,

MY DEAR L.,&mdash;I return H. Gladstone's letter which I regard
as most important.  I am very glad to think Gladstone is not
being intimidated out of his position by the pitiless storm beating
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P303"></a>303}</span>
upon him.  I agree that nothing satisfactory can be done until
the House meets, and we shall then have a week before the
Address is read, and our party will have met, and we shall know its
mind, while personal communications will have become possible
amongst the Liberal leaders also.  I think Chamberlain is ruining
himself.  If Gladstone sticks to his text he can easily form a
Cabinet without him or the Mugwumps, and then where will they
be?  Trevelyan's speech to-day is very bad too, but they are all
ciphers until Gladstone puts his one before their noughts.

CHAPTER XII
<br><br>
THE SPLIT IN THE LIBERAL PARTY
</h3>

<p><br></p>

<p class="t3">
<i>Mr. Labouchere to Mr. Chamberlain</i>
</p>

<p class="quote">
10 QUEEN ANNE'S GATE, Jan. 1, 1886.
</p>

<p class="quote">
MY DEAR CHAMBERLAIN,&mdash;No, I do not think that he (Mr. Gladstone)
is hedging; from his personal standpoint, he knows
that his only chance of coming in is to get over the Irish, and then
to get over his own party.  Waiting games may suit others, but
he cannot wait, and already considers that he has been out for
very long.  He thought so a week after Salisbury came in, and
at once commenced with the Irish.
</p>

<p class="quote">
This, I should imagine, is his game.  On the Address, he will
endeavour to put the Tories in a minority, with or without the
Irish.  He then expects to be called upon to form a Government.
He will at once begin to enter privately into terms with the Irish.
These terms will be much the same sort of thing as I wrote in the
<i>Times</i>, or non-appearance at all in the Imperial Parliament, after
the manner of Canada.  If he cannot make terms, it may be that
his desire for office will lead him to come in, but if he is to be
believed, he will not.  What will then be the position?  He
cannot well dissolve, so there must inevitably be a
Palmerston-Hartington Government, whilst the Radicals would be split up,
some going for the Irish, others against.  This, it seems to me,
means the destruction of the Radical Party for many a year.
Mr. Gladstone knows that he is too big an individuality to be the
head of a Coalition Government, moreover he has burnt his ships.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Suppose, on the other hand, the Conservatives dissolve at
once, after Mr. Gladstone has pronounced in favour of Home
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P305"></a>305}</span>
Rule.  On what cry should we go to the country, if not on Home
Rule?  Evidently those opposed to it would give the preference
to the Conservatives, for they one and all would have put their
foot down, whilst we should be tainted with the unholy thing,
even if we had made a Jonah of Mr. Gladstone.  So long as the
Irish question is not settled, the Tories must have the pull in the
country, and the Radicals must remain discredited and disunited.
</p>

<p class="quote">
This being so, is it not worth while to take the other course?
It is by no means certain that we should be beaten at an election.
Mr. Gladstone is still a power.  The Irish have votes which
would turn several places.  The electors may be divided into
people who think about the question of Ireland, and those who
don't.  For the latter a "cow" might be invented, whilst many
of the former would say that as one English party has gone for
Home Rule, it must come, and if so as speedily as possible.
</p>

<p class="quote">
The real enemies of the Radicals are the Whigs, and they are
essentially your enemies.  It is a mistake to undervalue them.
They have always managed to jockey the Radicals.  They hang
together; they have, through Grosvenor, the machine; they
dominate in Clubs and in the formation of Cabinets.  They
may ally themselves with you <i>re</i> Ireland, but this will be for their
benefit, not yours.  Nothing would give them greater pleasure
than to betray you with a kiss, for you are their permanent bogey.
Once you are out of the way, and the sheep of Panurge, <i>i.e.</i>, the vast
majority of the Liberal M.P.s, would be boxed up in their fold.
At every election we should have shilly-shally talk, very vague and
apparently meaning much, followed by half-hearted measures.
</p>

<p class="quote">
All this is why I still hold that the Radical game is to go with
Mr. Gladstone on Irish matters, and to use him in order to shunt
them and, if possible, the Whigs&mdash;not that this course is not full
of danger, but that it seems to me to present less danger than
any other.&mdash;Yours truly,
</p>

MY DEAR LABOUCHERE,&mdash;The more I look at the thing, the
less I like it.  Whatever we do we shall be smashed for a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P306"></a>306}</span>
certainty.  The question is whether it is better to be smashed with
Mr. Gladstone and the Parnellites or without them.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I believe the anti-Irish feeling is very strong with our best
friends&mdash;the respectable artisans and the non-Conformists.
</p>

<p class="quote">
One thing I am clear about.  If we are to give way it must
be by getting rid of Ireland altogether, and by some such scheme
as this.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Call Ireland a protected state.  England's responsibility to
be confined exclusively to protecting the country against foreign
aggression.
</p>

<p class="quote">
England's authority to be confined exclusively to the measures
necessary to secure that Ireland shall not be a <i>point d'appui</i> for
a foreign country.
</p>

<p class="quote">
The financial question to be settled by a fixed annual payment
to cover:
</p>

<p class="quote">
1. Ireland's share of the Debt.
</p>

<p class="quote">
2. A sinking fund to extinguish it in fifty years.
</p>

<p class="quote">
3. The cost of the military garrison.
</p>

<p class="quote">
<i>Query</i>: Should we hold the customs till this Debt is
extinguished, or find some other security for payment?
</p>

<p class="quote">
In order to gild the pill for the English sympathisers with
Protestant and landowning minorities:
</p>

<p class="quote">
Ireland to be endowed with a Constitution&mdash;the elements to
be:
</p>

<p class="quote">
1. A Governor with power to dissolve Parliament&mdash;no veto.
</p>

<p class="quote">
2. A Senate, probably elected but with some qualifications
to secure a moderately Conservative Assembly.
</p>

<p class="quote">
3. A House of Commons.
</p>

<p class="quote">
To meet the prejudices of English manufacturers and workmen,
a Commercial treaty pledging Ireland not to impose duties
on English manufactures.  (Bounties might be left open.)
</p>

<p class="quote">
In this case Ireland could have no foreign relations.  It is
impossible to allow her to communicate direct any more than
Australia and Canada.  But this was a great source of complaint
by Irish patriots in the time of Grattan's Parliament.
</p>

<p class="quote">
The difficulties of any plan are almost insurmountable,
but the worst of all plans would be one which kept the
Irishmen at Westminster while they had their own Parliament in
Dublin.

MY DEAR CHAMBERLAIN,&mdash;I think your scheme an excellent
one; only Ireland is so wretchedly poor a country, that it will
not pay its contribution; that, however, is a detail.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I am perfectly certain that Mr. Gladstone is determined to
go on, and that any idea of a Whig cum Radical demonstration
to induce him to keep quiet will not avail.  Rosebery writes,
"He is boiling over with the subject," and you know how, when
once an idea gets hold of his mind, it ferments; as Hawarden said
in a recent letter, he is determined to stand or fall by it.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I suspect that this scheme is passing through his ingenuous
mind.  To get in by the Irish vote, then to ask the Conservatives
to consult with him as to a plan.  The Irish, however, are quite
cute enough not to help him in, until, one way or another, they
are secured against this.
</p>

I have just received this from Churchill:

"The Queen's Speech will be delivered on the 21st.  No

You, sir, possibly have not been brought closely in contact

indeed been greatly struck with their largeness and broadness of

I suspect that Mr. Gladstone will not give the necessary
pledges to the Irish.  They have an idea that he might get in

in him.  Singularly enough they have not that amount which

DUBLIN, Jan. 7, 1886.
</p>

<p class="quote">
MY DEAR L.,&mdash;I am afraid I badly repay all your letters.  I
greatly fear that Chamberlain's tone shows that even if he accepts
the proposals in principle, he will help the Whigs to make
Mr. Gladstone minimise them, and thus they may prove inacceptable
to Ireland.  Then it will be the Land Act misery over again,
or rather your party would not be let in by us to pass a maimed
measure, and so the Tories would reap the profit of our dissensions.
<i>Beati possidentes!</i>  However, I think when your men get
blooded by a few skirmishes with the Tories, they will be willing
enough to patch things up to turn them out.  With regard to
Morley's point about the Veto, I recognise that the bigger powers
we get the more natural would be your desire for some guarantee
against their abuse&mdash;the better the Parliament, the more
effective the Veto.  As the scientist would say, you want it
increased according to the square of the power.  A Governor-General,
I think, would meet this, and, for my part, I think
it would capture or render quiescent a lot of the loyalists
if he were a prince.  A few Royal levees and some judicious
jobs would probably bring most of these gentry round in
a short time.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Your letters have been admirable, and I am sure have
done good, though none of us could write to the <i>Times</i> or
acknowledge it in any way.  Moreover, except through
extracts in the <i>Express</i>, none of us see it here.  A single copy
of any newspaper from across the Channel does not enter the
office of <i>United Ireland</i>!  However, as we are not your rulers
this is no crime.
</p>

<p class="quote">
The usual stuff I see is being talked about Home Rule leading
to separation, and how the American-Irish would not accept the
settlement, nor the Fenians.  The fellow who writes as "an old
Fenian" in the <i>St. James' Gazette</i>, extracts from which I have seen,
is Dick Piggott, late of the <i>Irishman</i> newspaper, who swindled
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P310"></a>310}</span>
every Fenian Fund he could milk, and whom the boys would
not touch with the tongs.  I undertake to say that if a suitable
Home Rule scheme be proposed, though Parnell said he could
offer no guarantees, that we could call a National Convention
to ratify it, and therefore could treat as a traitor every one who
afterwards opposed it, or did not loyally abide thereby.  Moreover,
terrible as are the American-Irish in English eyes, I believe&mdash;and
I have visited and spoken at every big city from New
York to San Francisco, and from Galveston on the Mexican
Gulf to Montreal in Canada&mdash;that we could summon a
representative Convention in Chicago, including the Clan na Gael,
the ancient Order, and the Rossa crowd which would endorse the
settlement and thereby effectually dry up the well-springs of
revolutionary agitation.  But to do this we must get no sham
vestry, but an assembly that would gratify the national pride of
the Celtic race.  Our people in America will only be too glad to
be allowed to mind their own business, and many of the wealthy
among them will come back and settle down here, investing
their capital and teaching the people the industries they have
learnt abroad.  The mass of them are as Conservative as any
in the world, and when I told a crowded meeting the night of the
Chicago Convention in 1881&mdash;referring to wild advice that had
been offered&mdash;"that the Irish leaders were no more to be bought
by American dollars than by English gold," the sentiment was
cheered to the echo and was mutilated accordingly in the report
of the <i>Irish World</i>.
</p>

<p class="quote">
However, this is running a long way ahead of events, and this
idea of mine is not one that I have yet broached to my colleagues.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I expect to be over on Tuesday, but hope to be allowed to run
back then till the 21st, as I suppose we shall have nothing to do
in the interval.  I don't suppose we shall make up our minds
as to whether we shall move an amendment to the Address, till
after we hear it read.  Even then this, I presume, would depend
as to whether a <i>modus vivendi</i> with you was arrived at, for if
the Tories are in earnest with their threat to dissolve, the best
tactics would be to have no Irish Debate and to cook their
goose on a side issue&mdash;Egypt, Burmah, or what-not.&mdash;Truly

Healy says that the Irish will decide nothing until the
Address.  They will not aid in turning out the Tories unless there
is a specific understanding as to what Mr. Gladstone's Bill is to
be.  If such arrangement be satisfactory, they will agree to vote
them out on Burmah, Egypt, or anything else, so as to render it
difficult for the Tories to dissolve.  They perceive the difficulties
of Mr. Gladstone's position and are just now in a yielding mood,
but beyond a certain point they cannot go, as their own people

MY DEAR CHAMBERLAIN,&mdash;I have just got a long letter from
Herbert Gladstone.  So far as I can make out, Mr. Gladstone
has in reality abandoned none of his projects.  But he is cornered
by the fact that the Irish will not aid him to get in without very
definite assurances.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Healy writes to say that he will be here on Thursday, and
that nothing has been decided as to the course of the Irish.  He
suggests&mdash;if some agreement can be come to&mdash;saying not one
word on Home Rule, but turning the Government out upon a
bye issue, Egypt, Burmah, or anything.  I have written to ask
whether the following plan would be assented to:
</p>

<p class="quote">
(1) Turn out Government on bye issue.  (2) Have some sort
of temporary scheme for governing Ireland.  (3) Appoint some
sort of dilatory Commission.  (4) Bring in Bill next year.  I have
explained that this would only be possible if Mr. Gladstone could,
in some way or other, make it clear to the Irish what the Bill is
to be, and also that he would stand or fall on it.
</p>

<p class="quote">
This would give time to educate public opinion, and to
have good Bills on English subjects, whilst it would render it
impossible for the Conservatives to dissolve.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I don't know whether I could get the Irish to assent&mdash;supposing
that Mr. Gladstone does&mdash;but I should be sanguine of
doing so.  They have now so arranged their party that practically
Healy, O'Brien, Harrington, and Parnell can do precisely
what they like.  Parnell I put last, because he will agree to the

MY DEAR MR. L.,&mdash;Herbert Gladstone is totally wrong
about me.  I neither saw nor heard from nor communicated with
Churchill or any member of the Government since the House
rose&mdash;I except the Irish law officers whom I meet daily in Court,
but whom I never exchange a word with on politics.  I am now
just of the same opinion I always held, but I don't see what we
can do till your party move.  It would play the devil with us
were we to put the Liberals into office and then have them to turn
round on us, by proposing a settlement we could not accept.
We cannot buy a pig in a poke.  You may say we could turn
them out at a minute's notice.  That seems very easy on paper
by counting parties, but if we are going to play this game
successfully the fewer ministries we turn out the better, as any
naked exhibition of our power in a gratuitous way would be
sure to get you a majority if you dissolved on that issue.  No,
we prefer instead of having to put you out, not to let you get
in, until there's a straightforward arrangement made.  At least
this is what seems to me to be commonsense.  I know nothing of
the Tory plans.  Of course, if they are fools enough to play your
hand by proposing coercion our hands may be forced&mdash;I only
write on the assumption that they have sense.  What I say is
let Mr. Gladstone satisfy Parnell and the whole thing is settled.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P314"></a>314}</span>
Was it from Grosvenor's experience and anecdotes of the Irish
party that the Duke of Westminster called us <i>debauchees</i>?  Were
we too lax in our attendance on Parliament to please Lord
Richard&mdash;prowling round St. John's Wood, when we ought to have been
braking his coach?  So we must please our fastidious censors by
arranging that the new party will sit up of nights in the House,

MY DEAR L.,&mdash;I don't think I could say anything fresh until
Thursday, when I shall go fully into matters with you.  I quite
feel the difficulties of Mr. Gladstone's position and think our
party fully appreciate them, and would even strain points to
obviate them, if this can well be done by men in our straits.
However, I would point out that on his side we have had nothing
but a repudiation of the principles attributed to him by the
"Revelations," and this, <i>plus</i> good intentions, is not sufficient
ground for eighty-six men to consult and decide on.  If no
communication is made to Parnell, as I think it ought to be, for
our meeting, we shall probably let things drift and do nothing.
I would have preferred all along not to have been the repository
of any views held by your Leaders, lest it might be supposed I
was trenching on the prerogatives of Parnell's position, and now
I think the time has come&mdash;if he is to be approached at all for
some communication to reach him otherwise than through me.
If I can be shown any honourable basis, on which we could vote
your party into power, I shall rejoice and will press my views

MY DEAR CHAMBERLAIN,&mdash;I send this to you by hand,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P315"></a>315}</span>
because if you are inclined to go on with the plan you suggested,
it will be necessary to act.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Parnell is quite ready&mdash;without prejudice&mdash;that is to say,
he says that he does not absolutely assent, but thinks that he will,
which you know, with him&mdash;who is more hesitating than Fabius&mdash;means
that he will.  His lieutenants agree&mdash;although he does
not know this.
</p>

<p class="quote">
But he says that, admitting that Mr. Gladstone can give no
pledges, he must know two things:
</p>

<p class="quote">
1. That Mr. Gladstone, if called upon by the Queen to form
a Government, will form one, <i>i.e.</i>, if Goschen, Hartington, etc.,
decline to join, that he will not throw up the sponge, for, with
considerable point, he says that he prefers the Conservatives to
a Hartington Government, supported by the Moderate Liberals
and Conservatives, and you as a Radical.  Such a Government
he might not be able to turn out, and it might remain master
of the situation.
</p>

<p class="quote">
2. He wants an understanding that if Mr. Gladstone comes
in he will act on his speech, and at once bring in his scheme for
the Government of Ireland.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I saw Herbert Gladstone, and he is to explain these two
demands to his father.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Herbert Gladstone says that his father would take office
without Hartington, but that his main difficulty is the Peers.
He hopes that he will be able to get over this difficulty very soon.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I have replied that at any moment the Irish may break out,
and that if once we get to Procedure we shall all fall to pieces,
and that the determination of the Irish to fight against Procedure
will very soon make us too.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I begged J. Collings to put off his amendment, and told him
that perhaps I might get him some votes.  Randolph Churchill
tried to bring the general debate to an end last night, but this
we stopped, and Sexton moved the adjournment.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Grosvenor asked me how long the debate would last?  I said
the Irish meant to keep it up.  He said that he did not want
them to.  I said that they were not asking him whether he did
or not, but that he was asking me now long it would last.  He
told me that he would prevent the G.O.M. ever going for Home
Rule, and then spoke about the Party.  He said, "You or <i>Truth</i>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P316"></a>316}</span>
are making a great mistake.  You assume that the Radicals
constitute the majority of the Liberal Party, but really the
Whigs do."  I asked him what would happen if the G.O.M. were
to retire; he replied, a Whig Administration under Hartington
with you&mdash;that you and the Radicals would soon perceive
that you were not masters of the situation, etc.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I, of course, did not tell him about Collings's amendment,
but it will be very difficult to get him to whip for it, and you will
have to put your foot down about it.  Parnell agrees, if they are
to be bought off, that the Irish shall appear not to take much
interest in the matter, but to vote up before the Whigs know what
is to occur.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Parnell is more than reasonable.  In his present mood, he is
all for a fair scheme.  His two <i>sine qua nons</i> are, that there should
be an Assembly called a Parliament for local matters, and that
he should have the Police.  He says that it would be absolutely
impossible for him to keep down the Fenians without this, and
that he is fully determined not to accept the responsibility.
About the veto, etc., he will make concessions, and give any
guarantees that are required.
</p>

<p class="quote">
He made a most conciliatory speech last night.  Before making
it he said, "There shall not be one word in it to which any
one can object."  He is very anxious to know about your feeling
on the matter of Mr. Gladstone's plans.
</p>

<p class="quote">
With regard to Ireland, he says that the people really cannot
pay their rents in some places, and that he is certain that if
nothing be done there will be rows in a few weeks.  But he is
doing all that he can to keep things quiet, and next week he will
dissolve some of the most bumptious of the Local Branch Leagues.
</p>

I told Herbert Gladstone that you had suggested to me the

MY DEAR LABOUCHERE,&mdash;... As regards out future policy
I can say nothing at present, but I think that a closer inspection

to me than he was when he first came to London.  If Parnell is
impracticable my hope is that we may all agree to give way to
the Tories and let them do the coercion which will then be
necessary.  They will be supported for this purpose by a clear
majority in the country and probably in the House.  As for

MY DEAR CHAMBERLAIN,&mdash;There would be much joy in the
Radical heaven if things could be hit off with you, and they
would all be ready to put Elijah's mantle on you if they could
come to some agreement as to this damned Irish question.
</p>

<p class="quote">
The feeling is, I think, this: they are in favour of Home Rule,
and do not particularly care about details, provided that the
scheme settles the matter.  They do not love the Irish, but hate
them, and would give them Home Rule on the Gladstone or
Canada pattern to get rid of them.  Home Rule, therefore,
whatever the Whigs may say, will be carried.  They are dead
against any employment of English credit for the Irish landlords
or Irish tenants.  This&mdash;whatever the detail of Mr. Gladstone's
plan may be&mdash;will be lost.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I rather suspect that the revered G.O.M. is playing a game;
he is bound to Spencer, therefore he is to bring in his Land Bill.
But, if it meets with disapproval, is it likely that he will throw
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P318"></a>318}</span>
up the Home Rule sponge for the sake of Spencer and the Irish
landlords?  Will he not rather say that it is a detail of a great
project, and not an essential one?
</p>

<p class="quote">
Now, just see what would be the position if we could act with
you on these lines?  The Whigs would be cleared out.  If
Gladstone is beaten, we would soon upset a Hartington cum
Conservative Government.  We might have grandiose revolutions&mdash;giving
cows to agriculturists, and free breakfast tables
to artisans.  We should be against Tories, Whigs, and Lords.
With you to the front we should win at an election, or if not at
once, later on.  There never was such an opportunity to establish
a Radical party, and to carry all before it.  Is it worth while
wrecking this beautiful future, for the sake of some minor details
about Irish Government?  You may depend upon it, that the
Irish, if not granted Gladstone's Home Rule, will never assent
to anything else.  Coercion would follow, and this would give
power to the Tory Whigs for years.  For my part, I would coerce
the Irish, grant them Home Rule, or do anything with them, in
order to make the Radical programme possible.  Ireland is but
a pawn in the game.  If they make fools of themselves when
left to themselves, it would be easy to treat them as the North
did the South, rule by the sword, and suppress all
representation.&mdash;Yours truly,

</p>

<p class="quote">
You objected to (1) Members being excluded, (2) Magistrates

is given up.  No. 1 is an open question, which is practically
yielded.  There remains, therefore, only No. 2.  As regards the
two Orders, I presume that Mr. Gladstone alluded to them, when
he said that he did not himself deem guarantees necessary.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P320"></a>320}</span>
There is no reason therefore why we should not throw them out
in Committee, or if they pass, and there is a Radical majority

As regards the Land Bill,[<a id="chap12fn6text"></a><a href="#chap12fn6">6</a>] I hear that Lord Spencer says that

Mr. Gladstone therefore avoids trouble by bringing it in, and as

throw it out on the Second Reading.

Your coming over would ensure the passing of the Irish

Arnold Morley would hold that, anyhow, you would vote for the

his father did not in the least undervalue your support, and

the Whips would be quite willing to sign it and to accept the
compromise.

<p class="quote">
MY DEAR CHAMBERLAIN,&mdash;I write you a line to catch the
post.  Herbert Gladstone told me that he had talked with his
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P323"></a>323}</span>
father on the matter last Saturday.  The difficulty of
Mr. Gladstone seems to be this: he has no great objection himself to
the Irish Members sitting here.  But he does not like to consult
his Cabinet, for fear of resignations, and does not like to give a
pledge without consulting them.  He considers that he has already
said a good deal in his speeches to show how open his mind is.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Now, would it not be possible for us all to vote for the Second
Reading, and to announce that we shall go for the Members
sitting in Committee?  It is true that we risk being beaten.
But, according to the Whips&mdash;and so far as I can make it out
they are correct&mdash;there is a majority for the Bill on the Second
Reading.  In the main the Members will vote for the principle
of Home Rule on the Second Reading, however opposed they may
be to certain details.  The estimate is that this majority will
be from fifteen to twenty.  As a rule, however, doubtfuls gravitate
into the party fold, so it possibly will be more.  It cannot,
however, be sufficiently large to make the Government independent
of us in Committee.  We shall be the masters of the situation,
and Mr. Gladstone will completely bleed to death instead of
being murdered by us, for the odds are that the Bill will never
come out of Committee.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I venture, therefore, to think that, seeing the difficulties of
Mr. Gladstone giving any specific pledge, seeing the tone of
Members, and seeing the objections to going against the vast
majority of Radicals and with the Whigs, it would be well to
rest satisfied, if Mr. Gladstone will distinctly agree to leave the
matter an open question.  I think that we can get a majority
of Radicals both on the "Member" question and on the "Order"
question.  The course I propose seems to be the best practically.
</p>

<p class="quote">
We have a meeting at the St. James's Hall, on Thursday, at
which I am to take the Chair.  The Resolution is conceived in
the above spirit, and I have already had rows with some of the
Members who are to attend, because they say it looks like
knocking under to Chamberlain.  It assents to Second Reading, but
trusts that the measure will be modified in a democratic sense in
Committee.  This we shall carry.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I do not myself believe in Morley's resignation, nor indeed in
Harcourt's.  It is possible, however, that the Lord Chancellor
will be firm, though I understand that he likes his salary.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P324"></a>324}</span>
Supposing that you voted against the Second Reading with
ten followers.  This would be a tactical fiasco.  If, however,
you carried all the Radicals with you&mdash;or almost all&mdash;in
Committee, this would be a tactical success, whilst the Radicals
would be delighted with your acting with them on the first, and
would act with you on the second.  Had we begun sooner, I
think that we could have got up a pronouncement against the
Bill, if the point were not yielded.  But most of the Radicals
have now compromised themselves.

MY DEAR LABOUCHERE,&mdash;The Resolution which you send me,
and which is to be proposed at your meeting to-morrow night,
seems well designed to unite the Radical party.  We are all
fortunately agreed that the principle of Home Rule in some shape
or another must be accepted, and we only differ, if at all, as to
the methods by which it is to be carried into effect.  For myself,
I firmly believe that Home Rule may be conceded in such a form
as to join the three Kingdoms more closely together.  On the
other hand, I fear that the effect of the Bill in its present shape
would be to bring about absolute separation at no distant date.
I hope the Government may see its way to accept the modifications
which Radicals advocate, and if any assurance to this
effect is given I shall gladly support the Second Reading in the
hope that minor improvements may be effected in it.&mdash;I am,

the friends of the Government that objectors should accept the

I do not believe there is really the least difficulty in allowing
the Irish Members to come to Westminster and there to vote

John Morley's difficulties are childish and perfectly insignificant

<p class="quote">
MY DEAR DILKE,&mdash;Chamberlain sent me a letter for the
St. James's Hall meeting, but it came too late.  It would not,
however, have helped matters, for he sticks to the phrase "the
Government accepts."  I had a letter from him this morning, much in
the same tone, also one from Morley, who says that Chamberlain's
speech is an attempt to coerce the Government, and that
they won't stand coercion.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I have been trying to get Chamberlain to agree to vote for
the Second Reading, on condition that the Government makes
the admission of Irish in Parliament a <i>bona fide</i> open question, on
which the House may vote without official leading and without
the Whips telling.  If he would do so, this would reconcile these
two babies.  I really don't see how Gladstone can accept modifications,
before Committee, urged in this <i>sic volo sic jubes</i> style.
Could you suggest from Chamberlain (as from yourself) that he
might be satisfied with the open question.  He says that he
would be beaten in Committee.  But I don't see this&mdash;and even
if it were so, he would have many opportunities hereafter to
get back his friends, the Irish, if he really wants them.  The
great point is to find some <i>modus vivendi</i> which would keep the
Radicals together, and to this he ought to subordinate much,
instead of making difficulties.  The Radicals do not take his
point about the objections to fight in Committee, and there will
be a row about his bullying the G.O.M.  On so big an issue, his
position is untenable&mdash;the Whig one is more reasonable.  If only
once a negotiation could be started upon the open question basis,
Mr. Gladstone would manage to dodge him into voting for the
Second Reading, and this is all that is wanted in Chamberlain's
own interest.&mdash;Yours truly,

I think that the feeling in the country is this:

<p class="quote">
They regard the principle of the Bill to be a Domestic Legislation
for Ireland.  The Radicals are in the main opposed to
"orders" and to exclusion of Irish.  They do not like the idea
of Radicals voting with the Whigs and Tories against the
principle, and the view that it would be impossible for successful
opposition to take place in Committee against the "orders" and
the "admission" is too complicated for their understandings.
In fact they don't want a Party division to be spoilt, and wish
to humble the Tories and the Whigs.

MY DEAR LABOUCHERE,&mdash;I think that you must now see
that the Irish Bills in their present form are doomed.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I have a list of 111 Liberals pledged against Second Reading.
Of these I know of 59 who have publicly communicated their
intentions to their constituents.  I believe most of the rest are
safe, but, making all allowances for desertions, there is not much
chance of forcing the Second Reading through.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I know of many men who are pledged like yourself to vote
for amendments in Committee, and some who are pledged to
vote against Second Reading if the amendments are not carried.
</p>

<p class="quote">
The Land Bill has no friends at all.
</p>

<p class="quote">
It is difficult to say what my own following as distinguished
from Hartington's is, but I reckon that something like fifty
would vote for Second Reading, if my amendments were
conceded.
</p>

<p class="quote">
It is time that a final decision was taken.  The fight is
growing hotter every day and the division of the party will be
irretrievable if the controversy is pushed much further.  I am not
surprised at the action of the Caucuses.  I know them pretty
well, and they consist of the most active and thoroughgoing
partisans.  But it is the men who stay away who turn elections,
and there will be a larger abstention on this Irish question than
we have ever had before in the history of the Liberal party.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I believe the issue is in the hands of Radicals like yourself.
If you exert the necessary pressure the Bills may be recast.
Much has been done by their introduction.  The Party as a
whole has accepted their principle of Home Rule, and we might
come to an agreement about the details.  But this will be out
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P330"></a>330}</span>
of the question if we go into opposite lobbies on the Second
Reading.
</p>

<p class="quote">
There is no necessity to withdraw the Bill at once.  If the
Government will give the necessary assurance of amendments
to retain Irish Representation and Imperial control of taxation,
we might carry Second Reading and then the Bills could be
committed <i>pro forma</i> for the necessary changes, or withdrawn
for the session.
</p>

<p class="quote">
All our people would be delighted at the postponement of the
dissolution, and in the interval we might kiss and be friends.

MY DEAR CHAMBERLAIN,&mdash;I have been doing my best to get
some sort of <i>modus vivendi</i> in which the honours of war would be
divided.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I had a letter from Morley yesterday in which he promised
to be most conciliatory at Glasgow.  He said:
</p>

<p class="quote">
"I don't think there is a pin of difference between you
and me as to the desirableness of passing the Second
Reading at almost any cost.  But Chamberlain wants
us to go down on our knees, and this cannot be done for
the money."
</p>

<p class="quote">
He had previously suggested to me what he said, I see, at
Glasgow about the Irish Members coming back in three years.
I replied that this might possibly form a basis, but that it must
in this case be understood that they came back without any
further legislature on the subject.  To this he demurred, but I
think that he would not make difficulties.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I do not dispute your figures, but I would point out to you
that some of your fifty can be manipulated.  As a rule a big cave
does not hold together.  Some of its Members in the end take
refuge in voting for a Party Bill, and give as a pretext some
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P331"></a>331}</span>
phrase used by the Minister for having done so, and in the
G.O.M. you have a past master in these sort of catching phrases.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I was brought up in diplomacy.  When two countries send
each other their ultimatums, a third country desirous of peace
proposes something between the two, and peace is made upon
its adoption by the belligerents.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I have been suggesting that Mr. Gladstone should agree to
leave the question an open one, the word "open" being understood
to signify that the Whips do not tell, and that every
one&mdash;Ministers included&mdash;should be allowed to vote as they please.
I don't well see how the G.O.M. could go further.  Although
we may call it a detail, the exclusion of Irish Members is really
a fundamental principle in the Bill, and were he absolutely to
agree to change it, this would be, as Morley says, going down on
his knees to you who, whether right or wrong, are the head centre
of the Radical minority, and not of the majority.  Would you,
yourself, eat humble pie to this extent?  Moreover, I think
that, if he had to submit this proposal to his Cabinet, there would
be suspicions, and the Cabinet just now can hardly stand another
split.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I have never gathered that Mr. Gladstone himself is opposed
to the retention of the Irish.  All that he says is, "The problem
is a difficult one: show me a good plan and I have no objection
to adopt it."
</p>

<p class="quote">
There is another way of meeting you, but I don't know
whether Mr. Gladstone would accept it.  It is this.  Leave
matters as they now are with respect to the Irish Members, by
eliminating all clauses excluding them.  Their position would
thus be left to future legislation on the subject.  They would
in this case sit as they are, and vote upon Imperial and
English local issues until the entire question is treated in a
separate Bill.
</p>

<p class="quote">
A third plan might be that of John Morley's, to exclude them
for three years, and for them at the end to come back as they
are now, unless any alteration during the interval be legislatively
made in their position.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Parnell is very much opposed to the retention.  He puts his
opposition upon the difficulty of getting Irishmen to come over.
He asks whether there are to be two separate elections, or only
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P332"></a>332}</span>
one.  In the first case, he complains of the expense and of the
difficulty of finding men, in the second he asks how men can sit
and vote in both Parliaments when they are both sitting at the
same time.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Do pray be conciliatory in the matter, and be satisfied with
the substance.  If the "open question" were granted, I am sure
that you would have a majority of Radicals, who agree with you
in the main, but think that they ought to regard the Second
Reading at the conservation of the principle of a domestic
Legislature for Ireland.  After all, a General Election with a Radical
split would either give Mr. Gladstone a majority against you,
or would end in a Conservative victory, neither of which would
be a gain to you.

At Stroud we had a meeting.  The Whigs did not attend.
Winterbotham took the chair.  He announced that he should
vote against the Bill.  There were groans and "three cheers
for Gladstone."  I went for the Bill, but explained that it
was desirable that the Irish Members should be retained,
and that this was your view.  There were shouts of "let him
vote with Gladstone on the Second Reading."  At the end
some overzealous ass proposed "three cheers for Brand."  This
was met with a chorus of howls and groans.  I enquired
later on what was the real position, and was told that all
the Radicals were against Brand, but that there would be
no use calling upon him to resign, as about five hundred Whigs
would stick to him, and these with the Conservatives would
secure his return.
</p>

<p class="quote">
At Ipswich the meeting was entirely for the Second Reading.
I praised up Collins, etc.  They cheered his name, but
whilst dead against the Land Bill, went for the other Bill, and
did not seem to care much for details.  Two of the County
Members spoke.  They had been returned&mdash;mainly through
Collins's exertions&mdash;but they told me that the agricultural
labourers wanted the question settled, and did not care much how it
was settled.&mdash;Yours truly,

MY DEAR CHAMBERLAIN,&mdash;Mr. Gladstone has your ultimatumest
of ultimatums.  My impression is that he will assent.
I had a talk with Morley this morning, and knocked it well into
his head that the question, as you say, is to be or not to be as
regards the Bill.

Of course they don't take yours <i>au pied de la lettre</i>, but they
evidently are thoroughly uncomfortable about them.  They
admit that the feeling throughout the country is in favour
of the Irish remaining.  Harcourt blustered fearfully in the
Cabinet about his intentions.  Perhaps it might be well if
you were to write him a letter.  If we can bring about an
arrangement, it will be a great thing for the party&mdash;put aside
the Bill.&mdash;Yours truly,

MY DEAR CHAMBERLAIN,&mdash;Since writing to you Arnold
Morley asked me to come into his room.  He said that he had
been shown your letter, and wished to ask me whether I thought
that the terms were the lowest that you would take.  I said
"Yes," that I thought they were.  Was I quite certain that you
would not vote for the bill if there were no concession?  Quite
certain.  Was it to be understood that you would vote for it if
Mr. Gladstone said that the Government would support or bring
in a clause granting representation to Ireland, leaving it for
Committee to say how many constituted representation?  I
said, that I understood this, but that he had better consult your
letter.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I see that there would be a row at once if Mr. Gladstone were
to go into details, so I should think that it would be better to
leave them alone.  I told him that moreover Members (one
had) had told me that they would only vote for the Bill if you
were satisfied, and that he must perceive that the Radicals were
in favour of the Irish remaining here.  He admitted this, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P335"></a>335}</span>
promised to explain this to Mr. Gladstone; he had, he said,
in fact represented this to him ten days ago, only then your
terms were not so limited as now.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Perhaps it might be well if you would write me a line (not
in answer to this, or as though I had written to you) urging a
speedy settlement&mdash;for Mr. Gladstone is apt to wait for something
to turn up to his advantage.

I have not heard anything from Mr. Gladstone, but have

<p class="quote">
MY DEAR LABOUCHERE,&mdash;I have a number of enquiries as
to what I am going to do.  I thought I had made it all clear in
my speeches, but I reply to every one that I shall certainly vote
against Second Reading unless I can get satisfactory assurances
beforehand; and that I will not vote for Second Reading unless
I know that the Government will keep the Irish Representation
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P336"></a>336}</span>
on its present footing.  That means, of course, either 103 members
or a reduction according to population.  Any other representation
would be illogical and absurd.  The interest of Ireland
in Imperial questions is in proportion to population and not to
her share of total taxation.  It might be in proportion to her
share of the taxation for <i>Imperial</i> objects.  Surely the best plan
would be to accept your suggestion and for the Government to
agree to drop the clauses about Representation at Westminster,
leaving it an open question for Committee whether there should
be any reduction, or any restriction on their liberty of speaking
and voting on non-Imperial subjects.
</p>

<p class="quote">
But will not Mr. Gladstone be content to secure the affirmation
of the principle by Second Reading, vote, and then commit
the Bill <i>pro forma</i> for amendments or withdraw it for the session?
</p>

<p class="quote">
If anything is to be done it should be at once, otherwise I
doubt if, even with my assistance, the Second Reading can be
carried.  The opposition is more numerous than I supposed,
and is growing.&mdash;Yours very truly,

MY DEAR CHAMBERLAIN,&mdash;Morley would have agreed to
leave out the clause.  Mr. Gladstone would not.  He has
elaborated some alternative scheme, which is to come before
the Cabinet to-morrow.
</p>

<p class="quote">
From your personal standpoint I should say "take it."  It
will be a substantial concession, and will be made to you.  If you
do not, very possibly several of your followers will accept it.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I really don't believe that you will get more.  It will fully

that if you want ninety Irish, you ought to have them; and, in
fact, the simplest thing is to leave the lot as they are.
</p>

<p class="quote">
It was admitted that the Bill would require modifications,

<p class="quote">
MY DEAR CHAMBERLAIN,&mdash;Morley has just been here.  He
don't want you to be told more than that you will be satisfied.
I told him that I had seen you, and had said generally that you
were mistaken in supposing that the Cabinet did not intend to
yield, and that I had gathered from you that if they did, you
would probably vote for the Second Reading.  They are, I find,
in some trouble about their definite statement about the third
point&mdash;the right of the Irish to come here by requisition of the
Dublin Parliament on all Imperial matters.  They are prepared
to elaborate some plan for them to legislate&mdash;or to have the power
to legislate&mdash;upon such matters, but they have not yet themselves
made out the plan to their satisfaction, nor can they agree as to
what is Imperial and what is not.  Mr. Gladstone therefore will
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P340"></a>340}</span>
be rather guarded on this head, but he will (says Morley) make
it quite clear that they accept the principle, and they <i>bona fide</i>
are prepared to give it effect.  They are, moreover, rather afraid
of being too definite, because they have not seen nor heard
anything from Parnell, and will not have the opportunity to do so
before the debate commences.  They assert that practically
representation and taxation involve pretty well all Imperial
measures&mdash;and this is to a great extent the fact, for the Crown
declares war, makes treaties, etc.  Anyhow they are quite ready
to meet you on this, and if you think that Mr. Gladstone's words
are too vague, or can suggest any others, Herschell will consult
with you.  Morley says that they are not going to take the
debate next week, <i>de die in diem</i>.  So if needed, anything can be
cleared up on Tuesday.  But he, of course, is anxious that you
should declare your acceptance of the Bill as soon as possible.
</p>

MY DEAR CHAMBERLAIN,&mdash;Morley did not leave until one
o'clock this morning, when I had a letter posted to you.  I think
that I put it perhaps too strongly about the "On Imperial matters,"
but I had been fighting for the exact words, and was cross
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P341"></a>341}</span>
about their not being precisely as I understood they were to be.
Morley vowed that they would be.  I said that they were not.
Practically they are.  I really do believe that they have not got
a definition of "imperial," and they only do not want to bind
themselves to the Irish Parliament being obliged to <i>demand</i>
representation.  I said "peace and war."  Morley replied, "this
belongs to the Crown, and is raised by supplies."  I suggested
"a commercial reciprocity treaty."  He replied, "this too is in
the hands of the Crown, and is raised by a change in taxation."
</p>

<p class="quote">
I do not think that there is any <i>mala fides</i>, but a desire to
avoid hostile criticism, on "what is Imperial."  Morley vowed
to me again and again that there was no intention to dodge, and
that having given up the principle they asked for nothing better
than to make it full.  I suggested, "all questions not excluded by
the Bill."  He replied, "state what questions, not involved in
taxation, you mean, and show where one does not overlap the other."
</p>

<p class="quote">
As regards the Committee, they still hold to it, and this will
cover most of the questions.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Please think this over, and if you can suggest any definite
line of demarcation, and will give it me in the House, I will let
Mr. Gladstone have it before he speaks.
</p>

<p class="quote">
My last words to Morley were: "Chamberlain is quite fair on
his side: he has a natural distrust of the old Parliamentary hand,
and will not be humbugged.  He no doubt will not quarrel over
mere words, but he must have the substance.  Knock this well
into Mr. Gladstone's head."

MY DEAR CHAMBERLAIN,&mdash;I gave Arnold Morley three
questions to take to Mr. Gladstone.
</p>

<p class="quote">
1. Would he propose the retention of Irish Members for all
questions of taxation?
</p>

<p class="quote">

<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P342"></a>342}</span>

<p class="quote">
3. Would taxation include everything which was involved
in Imperial taxation affecting them?
</p>

<p class="quote">
He answered "yes" to all, but said that in regard to taxation
he had suddenly thought that the tea tax is renewed every year,
and that he had not put this before the Cabinet, but he personally
had no sort of objection to their voting on it, and did not suppose
that the Cabinet had.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I suggested that Herschell should see you.  He writes to say
that he will be engaged all Tuesday and suggests Wednesday.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I have told them&mdash;which they all know&mdash;that the speech has

This they admit.

<p class="quote">
MY DEAR CHAMBERLAIN,&mdash;If I speak to-day or to-morrow,
I shall say nothing about negotiations.
</p>

<p class="quote">
This is, I think, about what occurred.  Mr. Gladstone was
ready to yield and bring in the "Imperial matters" Clause before
the Saturday Cabinet.  At the Cabinet he was asked whether
he had elaborated such a clause, which previously he had said
was impossible to devise.  He had to admit that he had not, and
so a lot of asses, some of whom did not understand the exact point,
and the necessity of sticking to any agreement, talked on until
it was time for them all to go away.
</p>

<p class="quote">
On Sunday, when I first saw Arnold Morley after receiving
your note, he vowed that it was all agreed to, and as I told you
I wrote down the three points in his presence.  When he came
in the evening, after having sent to Mr. Gladstone, he explained
that it was impossible absolutely to say that Mr. Gladstone would
pledge himself to bring in the Third Clause, because he had not
framed any Clause, and could not give a definite promise until
he knew whether he could frame it.  I urged him not to leave
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P344"></a>344}</span>
Mr. Gladstone until he had framed it, and there was a Cabinet
on Monday.  Still it was not framed.  Hence Mr. Gladstone's
extraordinary shilly-shally speech.  They all perceived what
fools they had been, except those who were anxious that no
agreement should be come to with you (notably Harcourt who
is playing for the succession), and it was hoped that Herschell
would be able to smooth down matters.  There was to be a
Cabinet on Thursday, and I think the Clause would have been
framed, only by this time they did not see why they should yield,
if concession would not ensure the Bill, and Mr. Gladstone (as
usual) thought that time should be taken to see how things
developed themselves.
</p>

<p class="quote">
In the House, as you know, there is a feeling that the Bill
should be read as a declaration of the principle of "a local
legislature," and nothing more.  Mr. Gladstone has not said a word
about this.  It would be a bitter pill, and he is just now in a
prophetic state of belief that, if he dissolves, he will carry
everything before him.  What the Constituencies will do, neither you,
nor he, nor any one else can predicate.  It may be that with the
Irish vote, the desire to settle, the belief in him, and the notion
that he has been treated ungenerously, he will win.  My impression
is that we shall be much as we are, except that the Tories
will be strengthened at the expense of the Liberal and Radical
seceders.

Now, I put this to you for my private information.  It is no
proposal from Government.  They hold that you are irreconcilable,
and are sulking.  Supposing that he would withdraw the
Bill after Second Reading, could you have a better and a bigger
triumph?  Read Salisbury's speech.  Does this look like real
union?  Randolph is used to promise privately, but Salisbury
has a vague idea of honour, and so he explains what such promises
are worth.

does he love you?  No.  The Whigs are all running about
boasting how they have you in their toils.
</p>

<p class="quote">
You may believe me or not, but I really do want to see a way
to a reconciliation, because I want you to be our leader.  A
reconciliation is still possible on the basis of withdrawing the
Bill after reading it a second time.  To withdraw it before would
be too much humble pie, and Mr. Gladstone sees&mdash;and no doubt
you do&mdash;that this would ruin him.  Moreover, the man has
some feeling in the matter.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Supposing that you were to announce on Thursday that the
Government must withdraw after Second Reading.  If Mr. Gladstone
was to do this, afterwards, he would be knocking under
completely, and yet almost all the Radicals (except Illingworth
and Co.) would endorse your suggestion.
</p>

<p class="quote">
By autumn many things may happen.  Mr. Gladstone
would have brought in a Bill, he would have withdrawn it on
your demand, and you may depend on it, he never would bring
in one again in the same shape, but one satisfactory to Radicals
and unsatisfactory to Whigs and Conservatives.
</p>

<p class="quote">
This therefore seems to me far better than discussing concessions,
whilst from your own standpoint I emphatically say that
it is better for you than to go to the country against Mr. Gladstone,
against what is called the party, and with such a lot as
Salisbury and the Whigs, who regard you as the devil incarnate.
Let the latter gravitate to the Tories.
</p>

<p class="quote">
There is also this: sentiment is a factor in politics.  The notion
that you are in any way acting ungenerously to Mr. Gladstone
renders, or will render, the Radicals rabid against you, and after
all they are the only persons who agree with you in politics, or
who have any real idea of being <i>your party</i>.

MY DEAR LABOUCHERE,&mdash;I have never doubted your sincere
desire to bring about an arrangement.  I do not intend to make
any allusion in public to the negotiations.  I blame no one for
their failure&mdash;there were misunderstandings on both sides.  But
I cannot conceive how Mr. Gladstone could have supposed that
the terms of his speech were calculated to meet the objections
taken.  As regards the present situation I am pledged now to vote
against the Second Reading, and I must do so, whatever may be
said as to subsequent withdrawal.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Our friends feel&mdash;and I think they are right&mdash;that they cannot
treat a vote for Second Reading of a Bill as though it were only
an abstract resolution.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I admit the truth of nearly all that you say as to the prospects
of the party.  No man can foretell the results of the General
Election, but I expect with you that the Tories will gain.  I think
they will gain chiefly at the expense of the supporters of the Bill,
but in this I may be mistaken.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I cannot struggle against the torrent of lies and slanders
directed against my personal action.  I can only say that I have
been, I believe, more anxious for reconciliation that any one of my
followers or present allies.  I have not to my knowledge said a
single bitter word about Mr. Gladstone, or expressed either in
private or in public anything but respect for him and belief in
his absolute sincerity.  Yet in spite of this the supporters of the
Government are more bitter against me than against any one
else.
</p>

<p class="quote">
For the present I shall maintain the same reserve, and shall
not attempt reprisals; but if the discussion goes on much longer
on the same terms I suppose I shall have to defend myself and
to say what I think of some of those gentlemen who, having
swallowed their own principles and professions, are indignant
with me because my digestion is less accommodating.

I have an enormous correspondence, some of it hostile, but
most of it friendly.  The breach in the party is widening, and in

All I can say is that I have done all in my power to heal
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P347"></a>347}</span>
it&mdash;short of giving up my conscientious convictions and assenting
to measures which I believe are totally wrong.  I have not the
least feeling against Mr. Gladstone; he is sincere in all that he is
doing&mdash;but I cannot think favourably of many of those who are
loud in his support, but who to my certain knowledge are as

<p class="quote">
MY DEAR CHAMBERLAIN,&mdash;I am pretty certain that unless
wiser counsels prevail, Mr. Gladstone will not consent to
withdraw the Clause.  Childers, who has been doing all that he can
to induce him to do so, finds that the Cabinet (so far as they
have an opinion) are against it, and Mr. Gladstone strongly so.
Morley vows that he would rather die, and that sort of thing.
I cannot find that they have any valid reason for this, but so
it is.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Mr. Gladstone will, I think, in as plain words as possible (if
he can be plain for a few minutes), fall back upon the programme
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P348"></a>348}</span>
that we were negotiating, and say that he will so modify the Bill
in Committee that it will give the Irish Representation here on
Imperial matters, and he seems to have a notion floating in his
brain of announcing that if the Second Reading be passed he
will either withdraw or defer the Bill.
</p>

<p class="quote">
The notion seems to be that the Liberal opponents may be
put down at 100, and that this will reduce them to 70; these
calculations, however, are evidently upon exceedingly vague
data.
</p>

<p class="quote">
It is pretty clear that a number of the opponents do not like
the idea of a dissolution, and that they are very anxious for an
arrangement.  It is therefore quite possible that they will come
in upon some such basis.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Do pray think the matter over, and consider whether it is
not worth your while taking these assurances as a concession to
you.  Of course it is not certain that they will be definite, but
you might insist upon their being made definite in the House of
Commons.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I think that it is a proof of astounding weakness not giving
up the Clause.  These people can never make up their minds
either to fight or to make peace.  The G.O.M. has a natural
love of shilly-shally, and those around him encourage him in this
for their own purposes.  My own belief is that they don't want
you to vote for the Bill, and that you would spoil their game
if you did.  The G.O.M. cannot last, and if only you would
rally you would be certain of the mantle, whereas with Goschen
and Hartington you never possibly can get on.&mdash;Yours truly,

<p class="quote">
MY DEAR CHAMBERLAIN,&mdash;If you can agree to anything less
than the excision of the twenty-fourth Clause, and consider that
it would be useful to let Mr. Gladstone know this, could you
write me a letter stating your views?  This I could let
Mr. Gladstone have to-morrow morning, as a letter to me and <i>not
intended</i> for him to see, with the understanding that it is for his
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P349"></a>349}</span>
private reading and not for his Cabinet.  It might probably
lead him to go farther than he otherwise would in his concessions.
He, no doubt, wants to pass his Bill, and although he believes
that he would sweep the country at an election, he must in his
calmer moments know that he may possibly not do so.  But I am
certain that there are men in the Cabinet who, whilst pretending
to be in favour of conciliation, are doing all they can to
prevent it&mdash;some arbitrarily, and some because their private
ambitions point to your being forced into a position of antagonism.
I do not think that Mr. Gladstone will be likely to change in
regard to the Cabinet decision respecting the twenty-fourth
Clause.  The point therefore is to find some other mode of
ensuring what is practically a surrender in respect to Irish
representation here.  The excision of the Clause is the simple and
direct method, but when did our venerable friend ever take the
direct method?  If, however, he <i>clearly</i>, <i>distinctly</i>, and <i>definitely</i>
pledges himself to introduce a Clause having the same object as
the excision, and to incorporate it in his Bill, the result is the same,
although the road may not be quite as straight.  He might easily
be parried in the House by your saying, "I understand the Prime
Minister to, etc., etc.," and then you might fairly say that you
have got precisely what you want, and thus bear off the honours
of war.  You have never publicly insisted upon the particular
mode by means of which the desired end is to be
attained.&mdash;Yours truly,

MY DEAR CHAMBERLAIN,&mdash;I have just got your note and
have privately let Mr. Gladstone know your position.  I have
suggested this, that if he intends to insert a Clause giving the
Irish Representation, he must necessarily withdraw the
twenty-fourth, and that consequently he can use the word "withdraw,"
which might get over the difficulty.  But whether he will do
this, I don't know.  Except that the Cabinet would not hear of
the withdrawal, and leaving matters as they are in regard to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P350"></a>350}</span>

<p class="quote">
MY DEAR CHAMBERLAIN,&mdash;There is no doubt about the prorogation.
It was settled last night, much against the wishes of
some, who regard it as too much of a surrender.  I have been
urging that Fowler, who is to speak after some Conservative who
has got the adjournment for to-morrow, should translate from
one hour of Gladstonese into five minutes of English.  The
absurd objection to this is (as yet) that he is not in the
Cabinet.  My impression is that most of the Radicals will
return to the fold.  They don't like a dissolution, with a Liberal
enemy against them.  This is all very well for you, but the fry
will go to the wall in these localities.  Some of the Scotch have
also come in.
</p>

<p class="quote">
After all, if Mr. Gladstone withdraws his Bill and agrees to
bring in another, in which Clause twenty-four is to be reversed&mdash;the
exclusion being inclusion&mdash;he does more than withdraw the
clause, and the prorogation was really only decided on by
Mr. Gladstone in order to give you full satisfaction.  Caine, I hear,
says that he never will vote for the Bill&mdash;probably not, considering
the influence of the Cavendishes at Barrow.  If he did, he
would not get in.&mdash;Yours truly,

MY DEAR CHAMBERLAIN,&mdash;I think that I have arranged for
a written antidote which will appear on Monday to the "responsible
frivolity" of our loquacious and indiscreet friend.  I am not
yet quite sure whether it is arranged, so please don't say anything
to <i>any one</i> about it, or, if it appears, say that I had anything to
do with it.  <i>He</i> insists that he said in the House exactly what
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P351"></a>351}</span>
he had said at the Meeting.[<a id="chap12fn11text"></a><a href="#chap12fn11">11</a>]  Reading his speech, it is difficult to
pin him to any particular passage&mdash;the only thing that can be
said is that he used phrases, which might cover a wider principle
than "a domestic Legislature for Irish affairs."  I was asked to
put on paper my objections to the speech.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I took these points: (1.) that he made a vote cover a general
recognition of the Bill; (2.) that he studiously limited all
"reconstruction" to a particular point; (3.) that he implied, and almost
stated that the Bill was to be introduced, and made no clear offer
to consider the whole subject of the details which were to give
effect to the principle of his domestic Legislature principle, and
did not say that he would consider any suggestions offered to
him by leading persons in the Liberal Party.
</p>

<p class="quote">
These are, in point of fact, your criticisms, not mine.
</p>

<p class="quote">
<i>He</i> was astounded at any one not finding all this in his speech,
but I said that, surprising as this might be, no one friend or foe
had found anything of the kind.
</p>

<p class="quote">
It seems to me that the real object of all should be to tide
over the present conjunction, and to leave everything "without

they regard any doubt of his divine character as sacrilege.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I should have thought that Henry James' idea of not voting
would have suited both you and Hartington.  It certainly is the
most logical outcome of the position.  He says that the Bill is a
mere declaration of principle.  You say that it may be more.
He offers to withdraw the Bill, after the principle has been ratified
by a vote.  You cannot quite believe him in anything beyond
that the Bill will be withdrawn.  This being so, if all of you were
to agree to leave him and his principle to find their level in the
House of Commons&mdash;to say that you are for a domestic legislature,
and therefore cannot vote for the Bill, but that you are not
for more, and therefore that you cannot vote for a Bill which
may involve more.  I think that this would put you quite right
with the Radicals, and leave you a free hand, although it may
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P352"></a>352}</span>
be doubtful whether the Whigs, who go against principle and
details, would be quite so wise to accept this solution.
</p>

<p class="quote">
If, however, the Whigs do vote, and if you and your people
abstain, it is not quite certain that we should carry the Bill; in
which case the outcry would be against the abstainers, and they
would be cursed for precipitating a dissolution against the idol.

<p class="quote">
MY DEAR CHAMBERLAIN,&mdash;At the desire of a large number of
Radical Members of Parliament, I write to make an appeal to
you with regard to your attitude upon the Government for
Ireland Bill.  They are all of them amongst your warmest
admirers, and they have always looked to you as the leader of their
phase of political thought.  They advocated your "unauthorised
programme" at the last General Election, and they have
persistently defended you against the attacks and aspersions of all
who have denounced you and your views upon political or social
issues.  With much that you have said upon the Irish Bill they
agree, and they think that they have a right to ask you to give
a fair consideration to any request that they may make to you
in order to maintain the union which they are anxious should
exist between you and them.  In your speech upon the Second
Reading of the Bill, you said that you were in favour of the
principles of a separate domestic Legislature for Ireland, with
due reservations, but that you did not consider that Mr. Gladstone
had made it sufficiently clear that voting for the Bill would
mean nothing but a recognition of this principle, and would
leave its supporters absolute independence of judgment with
regard to the new Bill that he might introduce in an autumn
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P353"></a>353}</span>
Session.  I think that he has met this objection in his letter to
Mr. Moulton that has been published to-day.  We think, therefore,
that perhaps you could not respond to our wishes, and either
vote for the Bill or&mdash;if you could not go so far as this&mdash;abstain
from voting.  The issue of the division on Monday is, we believe,
entirely in your hands.  Should the Bill be lost there will be a
General Election at once, which will disturb the trade and
commerce of the country; and it will take place at a time which, as
no doubt you are aware, will be the worst period of the year for
the Radicals, owing to the Registration Laws now in force.  It is
impossible to shut our eyes to the fact that a General Election,
without you on our side, may lead to a Whig-Tory, or Tory-Whig
Government, which would relegate to the dim and distant
future all those measures which you and we so ardently desire
may become law.  Under these circumstances is it too much for
us to ask you to make an effort to avert all these contingencies?
When Achilles returned to his tent, the Greeks were defeated.
What would it have been had Achilles lent the weight of his arm
to the Trojans?  I fully recognise how conciliatory your attitude
has been, and how anxiously you have sought to see your way
from disruption during all the discussions which I have had with
you.  I still cannot help hoping that, in view of the distant
assurances of Mr. Gladstone in his letter to Mr. Moulton, and in view
of the wishes of so many of your warmest admirers in the House
of Commons, you will see your way to defer to the request which,
through me, they make to you.&mdash;Yours truly,

The position is this: 316 pledged for, 136 pledged against,

not absolutely pledged on either side, or inclined to reconsider

I am really writing to you without speaking to any one of the

might yield very gracefully to the Radicals, and I make the

<p class="quote">
This occurred to me yesterday.  Mr. Gladstone might adjourn
the debate till some day in the autumn Session, and then
carry it on, after stating all the changes he will make in his Bill.
The difficulty of this is, that he vows that it is against all
Parliamentary rule to legislate after the Approbation Act.  I don't
know whether he could meet this by votes on account.  Then,
too, is it certain that he would have a majority?  If however you
approve of this, I would again suggest it.&mdash;Yours truly,

I am unable to accept your reference to my speech as quite
accurate, but I adhere on every point to the words of the original

assurance that he will not hold any member who may vote for
the Second Reading as committed thereby to a similar vote for
the Second Reading of the Bill when reintroduced in October,
but the question still remains whether such members will not be
obliged to take this course in order to preserve their own logical
consistency.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Up to the present time Mr. Gladstone has given no indication
whatever that the Bill to be presented in October will be
materially different from the Bill now before the House.  On the
contrary, he has distinctly stated that he will not depart from
the main outlines of the present measure.  It is, however, to
the main outlines of the present Bill that the opposition of my
friends and myself has been directed, and it appears to me that
we should be stultifying ourselves if we were to abstain at the
last moment from giving effect to our conscientious convictions.
We are ready to accept as a principle the expediency of establishing
some kind of legislative authority in Ireland subject to the
conditions which Mr. Gladstone himself has laid down, but we
honestly believe that none of these conditions are satisfactorily
secured by the plan which has been placed before us.  I share
your apprehension as to the General Election at the present
time; but the responsibility for this must, I think, rest with
those who will have brought in and forced to a division a Bill
which, in the words of Mr. Bright, "not twenty members
outside the Irish party would support if Mr. Gladstone's great
authority were withdrawn from it."&mdash;I am, yours very truly,

<p class="quote">
MY DEAR CHAMBERLAIN,&mdash;Yes, I thought of publishing
if you were to agree&mdash;but if not&mdash;I rather think it would not
conduce to the Second Reading.  It might even if you said that
you would advise others to abstain, or something of that sort.
The G.O.M. will die rather than withdraw his Bill, but he might
perhaps be induced to adjourn the debate until autumn, if you
were to suggest this.  I am off to Twickenham, as I have Palto
and Ellen Terry coming down, who (thank God) probably have
never heard of the infernal Bill.  Randolph is, I believe, coming,
but I suppose it is no use asking you to join such frivolous society.
My conviction is that the Radicals are damned for years if we
are defeated to-morrow.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII
<br><br>
SOME CONSEQUENCES OF BALFOUR'S COERCION POLICY
</h3>

<p>
When Mr. Gladstone's Government was defeated on
June 9 by 341 votes to 311, the Prime Minister
immediately dissolved Parliament, and the General Election
was over before the end of July, the Unionist majority being
118.  Mr. Gladstone resigned on July 12, before the final
returns were sent in, and, when Parliament met again in
August, Lord Salisbury was Prime Minister, Sir Michael
Hicks-Beach, Chief Secretary for Ireland, and Lord
Londonderry, Viceroy.  The second great Home Rule battle had
been fought and lost.
</p>

<p>
Of course Irish affairs immediately occupied Parliament,
but on September 21 the Land Bill, introduced by Parnell,
and upon which, he warned the House, the peace of
Ireland depended, was rejected by a majority of 95 votes.
On October 23, the Plan of Campaign was launched and
furiously denounced by the Conservatives in the House of
Commons and on every platform throughout the country.
Sir Michael Hicks-Beach resigned the Chief Secretaryship
on account of his failing eyesight, and was replaced by
Mr. Balfour.  The first Parliament that met in 1887 was given
notice of two measures for Ireland&mdash;a Coercion Bill to be
introduced in the House of Commons and a Land Bill in the
House of Lords.  The Coercion Bill was the most stringent
of its kind ever introduced.  It abridged and destroyed the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P358"></a>358}</span>
constitutional liberties of the people of Ireland and created
new offences.  It withdrew the protection of juries, and gave
full powers to resident magistrates of dealing with cases of
intimidation and of holding public meetings against the will
of the executive.  It was proposed, moreover, that the
measure should be a permanent one, and not restricted to
one or a limited number of years.[<a id="chap13fn1text"></a><a href="#chap13fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p>
Two extraordinary events occurred in that year, in both
of which Mr. Labouchere played an important part.  They
both had their indirect origin in the coercive measures which
Mr. Balfour succeeded in passing through the House.  The
first took place during the spring, when the <i>Times</i>, in order to
strengthen the hands of the Government, in their remorseless
warfare on Irish liberties, published, during the course of a
series of articles called "Parnellism and Crime," the
facsimile of a letter supposed to have been written by Mr. Parnell
to Mr. Patrick Egan in 1882, referring brutally to the
Phœnix Park murders.  The letter was contained in the
fourth article of the series.  The reader will easily perceive
from the following short extracts the spirit in which these
articles were conceived: "Be the ultimate goal of these men
(the Parnellites) what it will, they are content to march
towards it in company with murderers.  Murderers provide
their funds, murderers share their inmost counsels, murderers
have gone forth from the League[<a id="chap13fn2text"></a><a href="#chap13fn2">2</a>] offices to set their bloody
work afoot, and have presently returned to consult the
'constitutional leaders' on the advancement of the cause,"
occurred in the first article.  The third article declared that
"even now" the Parnellite conspiracy was controlled by
dynamiters and assassins, and proceeded thus: "We have
seen how the infernal fabric arose 'like an exhalation' to
the sound of murderous oratory; how assassins guarded it
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P359"></a>359}</span>
about, and enforced the high decrees of the secret conclave
within by the ballot and the knife.  Of that conclave to-day,
three sit in the Imperial Parliament, four are fugitives from
the law."  The first series of the articles finished up with
this appeal: "Men of England!  These are the foul and
dastardly methods by which the National League and the
Parnellites have established their terrorism over a large
portion of Ireland.  Will you refuse the Government the
powers which will enable these cowardly miscreants to be
punished, and which will give protection to the millions of
honest and loyal people in Ireland?"
</p>

<p>
It is very certain that all Liberal Unionists, and even a few
of the more educated Tory statesmen, realised that the
articles were merely theatrical appeals to the contracted
imaginations of those armchair politicians, whose ways of
influencing voters in rural districts were all powerful, but
it was not to be expected that the man in the street could
understand them as such.  On him they made a profound
impression.
</p>

<p>
The first article appeared on March 7, the second on the
14th, and the third on the 18th.  On the 22nd Mr. Balfour
gave notice of his Coercion Bill.  "Parnellism and Crime"
had prepared the way for him.  The Bill was read for the
first time in the beginning of April, and on the last day of the
debate on the Second Reading, April 18, the <i>Times</i> published
its <i>pièce de résistance</i>&mdash;what has since become known as
"the facsimile letter."  It ran as follows:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
15/5/82.
</p>

<p class="quote">
DEAR SIR,&mdash;I am not surprised at your friend's anger, but he
and you should know that to denounce the murders was the only
course open to us.  To do that promptly was plainly our best
policy.  But you can tell him and all others concerned that
though I regret the accident of Lord F. Cavendish's death, I
cannot refuse to admit that Burke got no more than his deserts.
You are at liberty to show him this, and others whom you can
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P360"></a>360}</span>
trust also, but let not my address be known.  He can write to
House of Commons.&mdash;Yours very truly,
</p>

<p class="quote">
CHAS. S. PARNELL.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
I have before me the photograph of the facsimile letter,
used in the Parnell Commission, and also the letters received
by Mr. Labouchere at different times from the Irish leader,
and it seems incredible, on comparing the general style and
caligraphy of the former with the latter, how the <i>Times</i>
agents and Mr. Soames could have been deceived for one
moment; but I must not anticipate in this place the verdict
of the Commission on the forgery, in the obtaining of which
Mr. Labouchere played such a characteristic part.  The
whole of England was indignant when the issue of the <i>Times</i>
containing the facsimile letter appeared on their breakfast
tables, and even comparatively tender-hearted persons
began to think seriously that no treatment of Ireland by the
English could be savage enough to avenge the cold-hearted,
calculating cruelty of Parnell.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Balfour's Coercion Bill had not, however, yet become
law, and the <i>Times</i> continued its popular articles, which were
greedily devoured by the public, the body of the second and
third series consisting for the most part of an accumulation
of evidence to prove that, in the year of the Land League,
the conspirators had succeeded in getting the American
Clan na Gael and the Irish Parliamentary party into line.
It did its work so well that, by the 8th of July, when the
Coercion Bill passed its Third Reading, under which,
subsequently, fully one-third of the Nationalist members
charged in its columns were put into prison, there were very
few English people outside the Radical faction who did not
think that Ireland had got no more than her deserts.
</p>

<p>
It was, in the <i>dénouement</i> of the series of events, following
upon the publication of Mr. Parnell's supposed letter, that
Mr. Labouchere played such an important part, and, as it
was nearly two years before the mystery was completely
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P361"></a>361}</span>
unravelled, the story of the forged letter must now be left,
so as to take up in chronological order the second event of
1887 in which Mr. Labouchere was vitally concerned.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Labouchere kept himself well in touch with what was
going on in Ireland, and the following detailed letter that
he received from Mr. T. M. Healy towards the end of 1886,
gave him a vivid picture of the state of things there during
the first half year of the Conservative Government, and
assisted him much in the line of policy he consistently
followed then and throughout the ensuing years:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
The country is really perfectly quiet, and the misfortune is
that the Tories are reaping the benefit of Gladstone's policy, and
will, of course, claim the credit for their "resolute
Government."  Moreover, they are putting
all kinds of pressure on the landlords
to grant abatements.  Buller is Soudanizing Kerry à la Gordon,
and giving the slave-drivers no quarter, so that with the stoppage
of evictions there, moonlighting is coming to an end and the
people believe that Buller won't let them be turned out of their
cabins.  He has a good man with him as Sec.&mdash;Col. Turner&mdash;who
was aide to Aberdeen during the late Viceroyalty.  Turner is a
staunch Radical and Home Ruler who sympathizes with the poor,
and we know very well that the brake has been put on against the
local Bimbashis.  They are cursing Buller heartily, and yesterday
he had to issue an official contradiction of the undoubted
truth that he is obstructing evictions by refusing police.  There
are more ways of killing a dog than choking him with butter.
How they would storm against Liberals if any such officer were
sent to Kerry to override the law, and how they denounced Morley
for exercising the dispensing power, because of a few sympathetic
sentences.  What I am afraid of in all this is that the tenants
nowhere are getting a clear receipt, and that they will afterwards
be pressed for the balances unless there is an Arrears Act.
Probably the Tories meditate muddling away the rest of the Church
surplus in benefactions to the landlords to recompense their
benevolence.  Of course only the September rents are due yet,
and September and March are much less frequent gale months
with us than November and May.  The November rents will be
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P362"></a>362}</span>
soon demanded, and then we shall really know what the landlords
will do.  I think they will surrender, for if they don't
they won't be paid.  Every one of them is sick of the fight.  Their
retainers and bailiffs who made a profit out of evictions, and the
attorneys who promoted them for the costs, have not been paid
for a long time as they used long ago, and like a stranded vessel
on the rocks it is only a question of the fierceness of the gale how
soon the entire system will go to pieces.  They were in much
better blood for fighting in '81 and what have those of them got
who stood out?  Desolate farms that no one will touch, while the
sight of emergency occupants no longer terrifies the tenants, who
know that they are costing the master three times the rent and
that their labours are as profitless as a locust's.  These fellows
are the riffraff of the towns who idle away their time in the next
public-house or play cards with the police sent to protect them.
They burn everything that will light for firing, and their occupation
of the premises is about as husbandman-like as that of a party
of Uhlans.  Such is the prospect for the gentry who refuse
abatements, and as they know the people have not got money, I
believe they will make a virtue of necessity.  Then the Government
are known to be against them, and they cannot appeal from
their own friends to the Liberals, so what are they to do?  They
distrust Churchill completely, and believe he is capable of
anything.  If, however, they hold out we shall have warm work.
I have refrained from addressing agrarian meetings so far, though
Dillon and O'Brien have gone on the warpath, because it is not
clear to me yet what is the best line to take, and besides I think
Parnell should give the note, so that nobody may get above
concert pitch.  What Parnell's views are I don't know, and he
is the man on the horse.  The consciousness of the people that
they have Gladstone on their side would in any case, I think, take
all the uglier sting out of the agitation, now that they feel a
settlement to be only a matter of time.  It is very hard for any one
to advise them when the responsibility is directly on Parnell,
but if he intervened popular opinion would blaze like a prairie
fire.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Thanks for your enquiry about my return to the House.
There are now three Irish vacancies, but I don't feel anxious to
go in now that I am out of the hurly-burby.  It is a heavy
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P363"></a>363}</span>
monetary loss to me, still, if it seemed my duty, I would stand again.
O'Brien hates Parliament and vows he won't go back, but if he
would consent so should I.  The English have no idea what a
beastly nuisance it is, giving up your work in order to live in
London, and then to be blackguarded as hirelings and assassins
for our pains.  I cannot think that there is much chance of
turning out Randolph for a long time to come.  Even if we could win
over Chamberlain, he has few followers, and Hartington could still
give the Ministry a majority.  I think the pair of them are trying
to kill Gladstone, and that this is quite as much a purpose of their
policy as to prevent Home Rule.  I feel sure that no modifications
of the late Bill that we could agree to would induce either of them
to come over.
</p>

<p class="quote">
In a Parliamentary sense Mr. Gladstone is a better life than
Hartington, as when the Duke of Devonshire dies his influence
will abate, and his followers in the House cannot be so well kept
together.  Joseph and he hate each other too much to agree on
anything else than disagreeing with Gladstone, so that I cannot
see any land ahead just yet.  I fear there is nothing for it but
to trust to the chapter of accidents.  Cloture cannot, if carried,
do us much harm.  If used to promote coercion then you will
have outrages and, for aught I know, dynamite once more in the
ascendant, so that while they may get rid of the pain in one part
of the system the disease will break out somewhere else.  Every
one here wants peace, and the wisdom of Gladstone's policy
is more manifest to me every day.  There is an entire change in
the temper of the people, and it would even take some pretty
rough Toryism to make them take to their old ways again.
</p>

<p class="quote">
If the present Government were wise they would take advantage
of this frame of mind, but there is little prospect of
their doing so.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
In the monster demonstration which took place in Hyde
Park, after the reading of the Coercion Bill for the first time,
Mr. Labouchere had been one of the group of eloquent
orators, including Mr. Michael Davitt, Mr. Sexton,
Mr. Hunter, and Professor James Stuart, who, from a long
semi-circle of pavilions, had led upwards of a quarter million
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P364"></a>364}</span>
demonstrators, poured out from the Radical Clubs and
Associations of London, in protest against the tyrannical
methods contemplated by the Government.  A short extract
from the speech of Mr. Baggallay, made in the House of
Commons on April 14, gives an interesting little picture of
Mr. Labouchere on the occasion of the demonstration:
"I see the member for Northampton in his place," he said;
"I am glad to see him back again after his short holiday,
a holiday which I was sorry to see that he himself had cut
short by unnecessarily making his appearance on a waggon
in Hyde Park.  May I be allowed to tell him that I was in
Hyde Park also, although I was not in a waggon.  I am
prepared to admit that the crowd there was orderly.  It has
been asserted that there were a great many rowdies present.
No doubt there were, but, for a Bank holiday, and for Hyde
Park on a fine day, I think the congregation assembled there
was fairly respectable.  But, sir, what did they go there for?
A great many were out for a holiday, but I believe that a
very large number went there in order to see the leader of the
Liberal party, or rather the real leader of the Radical party.
I was asked over and over again, 'Where's Labby?'  There
can be no doubt that the point of attraction was the
platform at which the member for Northampton presided.
The language Mr. Labouchere used in reference to this
Coercion Bill was not perhaps quite so moderate as it might
have been.  He told his audience that the policy of the
Government was like the ruffianism of Bill Sikes, and he
added that if the Bill became law he hoped Irishmen would
resist it."  (Mr. Labouchere: "Hear, Hear!")  "I do
not know if Mr. Labouchere is prepared to repeat those words
in the House&mdash;(Mr. Labouchere: "Most unquestionably
I repeat them.)"[<a id="chap13fn3text"></a><a href="#chap13fn3">3</a>]  And so on.
</p>

<p>
The protest had, of course, nothing but a moral value,
minimised as much as possible by a slashing leading article
in the <i>Times</i>, followed by a double dose of "Parnellism and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P365"></a>365}</span>
Crime."  But, in the September of that year, Mr. Labouchere,
in company with four other members of Parliament
(Mr. T. E. Ellis, Mr. Brunner, Mr. Dillon, and Mr. John
O'Connor), went over to Ireland, in order to address the
historic meeting at Michelstown.
</p>

<p>
Everybody knows the outline of what occurred&mdash;how the
police, escorting a Government reporter, tried to force a
passage through a hostile crowd to the speaker's platform,
and how they were eventually driven back into their barracks,
through the windows of which they fired at random, killing
three men and mortally wounding two others.  The meeting
occurred on September 9, and on the 12th the matter was
discussed during the debate in the House of Commons.
Mr. Balfour pronounced instant and peremptory judgment,
although his information on the subject must have been
obtained with incredible rapidity.[<a id="chap13fn4text"></a><a href="#chap13fn4">4</a>]  He told the House that
he was of opinion, "looking at the matter in the most impartial
spirit, that the police were in no way to blame, and that
no responsibility rested upon any one except upon those who
convened the meeting under circumstances which they knew
would lead to excitement and might lead to outrage."[<a id="chap13fn5text"></a><a href="#chap13fn5">5</a>]
Mr. Labouchere, following Sir William Harcourt and
Mr. Balfour, made a characteristic speech, in the course of which
he gave an inimitable account of what actually did happen
at Michelstown.
</p>

<p>
"Now, sir," he said, "I was there.  I was in a position
which enabled me to see very clearly what took place.  I
am not a novice in these matters.  I have been in a great
many <i>ententes</i> on the continent.  I have been a reporter in
some cases, and I have not only been in a position to see, but
I have also been in the habit of chronicling what I did see....
We went down, and the train arrived at Fermoy.
This is about fifteen miles from Michelstown, and when we
were within a mile of the latter place, we were met by a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P366"></a>366}</span>
procession with flags and trumpets, and a certain crowd
accompanying it....  We entered the town with this
procession, and pulled up in the market-place.  Michelstown
is a very small provincial town with very wide streets and
few of them.  In the midst of the town there is this
marketplace, which is perhaps as large as Trafalgar Square.  The
market-place slopes, and at the top, is the main street of the
village, and&mdash;I ask the House to remember this&mdash;there are
two police barracks.  One is the permanent police station
... and the other a temporary police station, used by the
police on this occasion, and faces the market-place.  When
we arrived there we got into a brake, which formed one
part of the procession.  This brake was mainly tenanted by
priests, the Mayors of Cork and Clonmel, and a few other
gentlemen.  Mr. M'Carthy, a parish priest of the neighbourhood,
was appointed chairman, and the crowd naturally
gathered around.  Mr. Dillon said to me: 'Let us cut this
as short as possible: they will send the police and military
into the town.  They will attempt something, and something
may occur if we go on long.  I suggest we say a few words
and ask the crowd to disperse.'  I at once assented.  Dillon
then got up on the front side of the brake to say a few words,
and at that time, or perhaps a few minutes before, I saw a
body of police drawn up in a line in the lower part of the
market-place.  They had a reporter with them, and they
pushed their way to within a short distance of the platform....
They could get no further.  The people were so tightly
packed.  I will give an instance of this.  When we got
there we got out of our carriage, and we were all going on to
the brake, which was, I suppose, five yards away.  I was
delayed a moment, and I was delayed at least two moments
trying to get through these five yards, the people being so
crowded that it was almost impossible to push through them.
How then was it possible for the police, three abreast,
without great violence, to push their way through such a dense
mass as this?  Our brake was at the top of the market-place,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P367"></a>367}</span>
the people were all in front.  Why on earth did not the
reporter go to the outside of the meeting, and down the
other side?  He could easily have got in that way, and we
should have been glad to welcome him there.  But the
police deliberately tried to force their way right in front
where the people were wedged in as much as possible.  I
then saw these dozen policemen, with the reporter in their
midst, stop.  I supposed then they were satisfied and saw
they could get no further.  Dillon made one or two observations,
and then the police fell back, and I thought perhaps
they were going round.  Let me observe we did not see the
Resident Magistrate at all.  If the Resident Magistrate had
shown himself, and said he wanted the reporter to pass, one
would have let him pass.  The difficulty was that the
reporter did not come alone, but with this body of police.
Dillon went on speaking, and the horsemen&mdash;not this wonderful
regiment I see mentioned in the <i>Times</i>, but some twenty
horsemen&mdash;closed round outside the meeting in order to
hear.  Suddenly, after the advance guard had fallen back,
and joined the other police, they (the police) all rushed
forward.  I am told they came to where these horsemen were,
and one of the policemen drew his sword, and wounded one
of the horses.  I believe Mr. Brunner saw this done.
Immediately there was a scrimmage....  The police
commenced and continued it.  The next thing that happened
was that the police ran away.  Captain Seagrove may have
been amongst them, but it appears he deserted them on this
occasion, and went to a neighbouring inn on the right of
the market-place....  The police ran into the barracks....
Brunner and Ellis got on the brake, and joined the
Mayor of Cork in urging the people to clear the streets for
fear of further bloodshed, and I remained on the brake,
because I was anxious to see what would take place."  He
continued his speech, urging with great ability the futility
of pursuing in Ireland such tactics, which amounted to
nothing in the world but the forcing upon a weaker country
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P368"></a>368}</span>
the tyranny of a stronger.  "The Chief Secretary tells us,"
he continued, "that, by these means, he hopes to create a
Union between England and Ireland.  What sort of a
Union does he expect to create?  Does he expect to create
a Union of hearts and affections?  Does he hope to create
an affection for the English Government?  I am happy to
see that in Ireland the people are making a wide distinction
between the people of England and the Government of
England.  They know their troubles are only temporary,
that a new alliance exists between the democracies of England
and Ireland, and that the classes will not be able to hold their
own against such an alliance.  I hold that the right
hon. gentleman (Mr. Balfour) is indirectly responsible for what
has occurred at Michelstown, and that those who are
directly responsible are R. M. Seagrove and Inspector
Brownrigg.  I accuse these men of gross and deliberate
murder."[<a id="chap13fn6text"></a><a href="#chap13fn6">6</a>]
</p>

<p>
After Mr. Labouchere sat down, there was really very
little to be said on the other side.  Lord Randolph Churchill,
however, endeavoured to do his duty by his party, and
commented thus on Labouchere's speech, craftily criticising
its style and ignoring its substance: "And then, Sir, we had
the statement of the member for Northampton, which seems
to me to resemble in its nature certain newspapers which are
now current, and, to some extent, popular in the metropolis,
which convey their news to the public in paragraphs.  The
statement of the hon. gentleman did not seem to me to be
altogether connected.  It was really a series of paragraphs,
which succeeded each other without much connection as
far as I could make out.  I put aside the statement of the
hon. member for Northampton, because I have difficulty
in regarding him as altogether serious in this matter."[<a id="chap13fn7text"></a><a href="#chap13fn7">7</a>]
</p>

<p>
It is difficult to see why Lord Randolph Churchill did not
regard Mr. Labouchere's statement on the subject as serious.
Had he been commenting on Mr. Balfour's speech on the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P369"></a>369}</span>
occasion, one might have understood a certain amount of
scepticism as to the speaker's good faith.
</p>

<p>
In the following February Mr. Labouchere, in a speech
on Mr. Parnell's amendment in answer to the Address from
the Throne, referred again to Mr. Balfour's airy dismissal of
any serious consideration of the Michelstown affray: "What
the Chief Secretary had stated in the House about the matter
was absolutely incorrect.  He had always thought that the
right hon. gentleman would be especially careful in matters
of evidence, for, as a philosopher, he was his (Labouchere's)
favourite philosopher.  He had sat at the feet of that
Gamaliel, he had read his <i>Defence of Philosophic Doubt</i>, until
he had almost doubted of his own existence.  Yet, when the
right hon. gentleman became Irish Chief Secretary, he forgot
all his philosophy.  The reason was that there were exigencies
required of an Irish Secretary that were not to be found in
the calm fields of philosophy.  It was a melancholy thing
for a philosopher to be plunged by the exigencies of his
position into matters like this&mdash;to have vile instruments to
carry out his orders, and to believe them or rather to pretend
to believe them...."[<a id="chap13fn8text"></a><a href="#chap13fn8">8</a>]
</p>

<p>
The note of persiflage contained in all Labouchere's
speeches on the Michelstown affair may have deceived his
hearers as to the profoundness of his feelings of indignation,
but his measured, well-considered utterances in <i>Truth</i> were
for all who read them a sufficient guarantee of his good faith.
Immediately after the affray, he wrote thus of the head of the
constabulary force in Co. Cork: "I came across a person of
the name of Brownrigg the other day.  The ferocity, the
insolence, the brutality of this man never were exceeded
and rarely equalled by Cossack or Uhlan in a country
occupied by Russian or German.  I strongly recommend him
for promotion.  He is a man after the heart of our Tory
despots, for he seemed to me to unite in his person every
characteristic that goes to make up an official ruffian,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P370"></a>370}</span>
armed with a little brief authority.  On this man the
responsibility of the Michelstown murders rests.  He caused
them, either deliberately, or from stupidity and brutality
combined.  If he has furnished Mr. Balfour with an account
of what took place there, he adds to his other virtues the
capacity of being one of the best liars that the world has
ever produced, for the statement of Mr. Balfour in the
House of Commons of the Michelstown affair, from 'official
information,' is one long tissue of deliberate falsehoods."[<a id="chap13fn9text"></a><a href="#chap13fn9">9</a>]
</p>

<p>
At the inquest which was held upon the victims, the jury
returned a verdict of wilful murder against the chief police
officer and five of his men.  <i>Truth</i> pronounced as follows
upon the inquest: "Immediately after the Michelstown
meeting I had occasion to call attention to the conduct of
Brownrigg, the chief of the constabulary there.  This
ruffian has given evidence, and his evidence is one long tissue
of lies, so impudent that Mr. Irwin, the District Police
Inspector, has borne testimony against him.  When Mr. Irwin
stated what the nature of his evidence must be, Brownrigg,
it would appear, called his men together and tried to
drill them into perjury, in order to obtain confirmation of
his mendacity.  I am not surprised at anything which this
man may do, for I found him vain, irascible, insolent, and
muddleheaded beyond all conception."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Labouchere's article, called "The Michelstown
Murders, "giving in more detail than he had been able to do in
the House, the real facts of the affray, is a masterpiece of
judicial summing up.  It is too long to quote in full, but the
following extract will show how close was his reasoning, and
how unanswerable his arguments:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
Three men were killed, and two were wounded.  Two of the
men killed received each two bullets.  This proves two things:
1. That the police deliberately aimed.  2. That there could not
have been a crowd.  Never yet was a crowd fired into, and, of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P371"></a>371}</span>
the three men killed by the discharge, two each be struck twice.
Any one can see that this is mathematically so improbable as to
be impossible.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Station No. 1 is a house with an iron door, and iron shutters
to the windows.  Even if it had been attacked, an unarmed crowd
could not have got into it; all the more as there were military
within call ready to act, and Captain Seagrove was not in the
station, and consequently could have at once called up the
soldiers.  It is admitted that there are 160 panes of glass in
the windows, and that only six of these panes were broken
by stones.  The police therefore were not in danger of their lives,
nor in any danger.[<a id="chap13fn10text"></a><a href="#chap13fn10">10</a>]
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The verdict of the inquest was afterwards quashed (Feb. 10,
1888) in the Queen's Bench on the ground that the
coroner had perpetrated certain irregularities of form, and,
as Lord Morley remarks, "the slaughter of the three men was
finally left just as if it had been the slaughter of three
dogs."  No other incident of Irish administration stirred deeper
feelings of disgust in Ireland, or of misgiving and indignation
in England.[<a id="chap13fn11text"></a><a href="#chap13fn11">11</a>]  Meanwhile the <i>Times</i> articles "Parnellism
and Crime" seemed to have been forgotten, except by
Mr. Labouchere, who had in <i>Truth</i> chaffingly suggested to the
<i>Times</i> the appointment of Mr. Brownrigg to write a few
instalments of the sensational serial pamphlet.  The poison,
however, had worked, and goodwill towards Ireland had
nearly died in English breasts.  Parnell had declared in the
House of Commons on the day of its publication that the
facsimile letter was a clumsy fabrication.  "Politics are
come to a pretty pass," he said, "in this country when a
leader of a party of eighty-six members has to stand up at
ten minutes past one in the House of Commons in order to
defend himself from an anonymous fabrication such as that
which is contained in the <i>Times</i> of this morning."[<a id="chap13fn12text"></a><a href="#chap13fn12">12</a>]
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P372"></a>372}</span>
</p>

<p>
Nobody except his Radical friends believed him, and the
affair would probably have sunk into oblivion if a former
member of the party, a Mr. F. H. O'Donnell, had not, after
mature reflection, conceived that he had been libelled in
the famous articles.  In the summer of 1888 he prosecuted
the <i>Times</i> for damages, and lost his case, for, as a matter of
fact, Mr. O'Donnell had not been mentioned in the articles,
and it almost appeared that something like a guilty
conscience had prompted him to bring the action.  But the
prosecuting counsel's method of presenting the case not only
compelled Sir Richard Webster to reproduce and exhaustively
comment upon the "Parnellism and Crime" articles, but
furnished him with the opportunity of startling London and
the world with a long series of other letters, some of them
more damning even than the facsimile letter, five purporting
to be from Pat. Egan, the former treasurer of the Land
League, addressed to various agitators and felons including
James Carey, the informer, and three supposed to be from
Parnell.  It is only necessary to this narrative to quote one
which was read out on July 4, 1888, by the Attorney-General
in his address to the jury.  It ran as follows:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
9/1/82.
</p>

<p class="quote">
DEAR E.,&mdash;What are these fellows waiting for?  This inaction
is inexcusable, our best men are in prison and nothing is being
done.  Let there be an end of this hesitancy.  Prompt action is
called for.  You undertook to make it hot for old Forster and Co.
Let us have some evidence of your power to do so.  My health
is good, thanks.&mdash;Yours very truly,
</p>

<p class="quote">
CHAS. S. PARNELL.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Dear E." meant Patrick Egan.  In January, four
months before the Phœnix Park murders, Mr. Parnell was
in Kilmainham Prison.  Well might the Attorney-General
say, as he solemnly read out the letter in Court: "If it
was signed by Mr. Parnell, I need not comment upon it."
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P373"></a>373}</span>
He also made the announcement that the "facsimile letter,"
as the first one published in the <i>Times</i> has always been called,
as well as the ones he had produced in Court that day, had
been for some time in the possession of the <i>Times</i>.
Presumably the <i>Times</i> had kept them in the hopes that the
Irish leaders would sooner or later bring an action for libel
against the paper, when they would triumphantly have
produced the letters and so confounded the whole party.
As it turned out, their production at that moment rather
resembled the killing of a fly with a sledge-hammer, for
Mr. O'Donnell's case was one of such palpable insignificance.
An important reason may be mentioned here, for explaining
what may seem to be an extraordinary lack of initiative on
Mr. Parnell's part.  He had not been willing to prosecute
the <i>Times</i> because he was firmly convinced that Captain
O'Shea had been concerned in the production of the letters,
and, to add to his unwillingness, his friends in England had
pointed out to him the immense improbability of a jury of
twelve Middlesex men, being, at that moment, sufficiently
without racial prejudice, to pronounce a verdict in his
favour.  After the Attorney-General's declaration that the
<i>Times</i> would retract nothing, and the implied challenge in
his admission that, if false, no grosser libels were ever
written, Mr. Parnell took action.  On the day of the delivery
of the verdict in the case of O'Donnell <i>v.</i> Walter, he formally
denied the authenticity of the letters, and asked for a Select
Committee of the House to enquire into the matter.  His
request was refused, but finally it was suggested from the
Treasury Bench that the enquiry should be entrusted to a
Commission of Judges appointed by Act of Parliament.  A
Bill embodying this suggestion was read for the second time
on July 24, and the names of the Commissioners were added
in the Committee stage.  Sir James Hannen was chosen as
President of the Commission, and with him were associated
Sir Charles Day, an Orangeman, and Sir Archibald Levin
Smith.  Mr. H. Cunynghame, a junior barrister (now Sir
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P374"></a>374}</span>
Henry Cunynghame), was appointed Secretary to the
Commission.[<a id="chap13fn13text"></a><a href="#chap13fn13">13</a>]
</p>

<p>
Mr. Labouchere had, of course, scented in the whole
business a chapter of <i>chronigues scandaleuses</i> after his own
heart.  He set to work to study it at once <i>con amore</i>, and
very soon came to the conclusion that all the letters had been
forged by one Richard Pigott, the story of whose chequered
career was soon to become the property of a marvelling
public.  "Immediately on the Egan letters being produced
in the O'Donnell <i>v.</i> Walter case," he writes in his own
account of the affair, "Mr. Egan telegraphed to me that he
was sending over Carey's letters to him.  (Mr. Egan was
then in America.)  These letters followed.  They referred
to a municipal election, and, being written at the same time
as a forged letter of Mr. Egan to Carey, they proved
conclusively that the latter could not be genuine.  Whilst the
discussion was taking place in Parliament about the Royal
Commission, Mr. Egan again telegraphed that he had been
comparing the letters ascribed to him in the O'Donnell trial
with the drafts of certain letters which he had written to
Pigott about the purchase of the <i>Irishman</i>,[<a id="chap13fn14text"></a><a href="#chap13fn14">14</a>] and the letters
ascribed to Mr. Parnell, with the copies of two letters written
by that gentleman to Pigott in relation to the sale, which
copies were in his (Egan's) possession.  He said that
he had found such a similarity of phrase in the genuine
letters and in the forged letters that he was certain that the
latter were fabricated from the former.  An emissary soon
after came over with the Egan drafts and with Pigott's
letters (one of which contained that blessed word
'hesitancy'), to which the former were replies, and with the
copies of Mr. Parnell's letters.  One of the drafts had been
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P375"></a>375}</span>
published previously as a part of a correspondence between
Egan and Pigott in the <i>Freeman's Journal</i>, and the copies
of Mr. Parnell's letters were in the handwriting of
Mr. Campbell.[<a id="chap13fn15text"></a><a href="#chap13fn15">15</a>]  Now it was utterly impossible that the similarities,
amounting in one case to three consecutive lines, could be a
mere chance.  It was, therefore, a mathematical certainty
that Pigott had forged the letters, while it was obvious that
Mr. Egan's drafts were genuine, for they could have been at
once disproved, if incorrect, by Pigott producing, at the
investigation, the original of them, which, it was to be
presumed, he had in his possession.  I showed the Carey
letters to Mr. Parnell alone, and the Egan correspondence
with Pigott to Sir Charles Russell and Mr. Parnell alone,
and then locked them up.  On Mr. George Lewis being
retained, I handed them over to him, and he proceeded to
get up Pigott's 'record,' only a portion of which came before
the Court, but a portion amply sufficient to show that he had
lived for years on blackmailing, forgery, and treachery."[<a id="chap13fn16text"></a><a href="#chap13fn16">16</a>]
</p>

<p>
Mr. Labouchere then went off to Germany for his summer
holiday, and, while abroad, a chance conversation revealed to
him that the incriminating letters had been already shown
by Mr. Houston, the Secretary of the Loyal and Patriotic
Association, to Lord Hartington.  Houston was therefore
immediately subpœnaed, and it later transpired that he had
offered them to the <i>Pall Matt Gazette</i> before he sold them to
the <i>Times</i>.  "Two facts were consequently certain," said
Mr. Labouchere.  "Houston had sold the letters, and Pigott
had forged them.  Although we were ourselves certain of the
latter fact, it was possible that, as we had only the drafts of
the Egan letters, it might be said (as indeed it was said, by
Pigott in the witness-box) that Egan had written his drafts
from the <i>Times</i> letters, instead of the <i>Times</i> letters having
been fabricated from the Egan letters.
</p>

<p>
"About the middle of October," continued Mr. Labouchere,
"Mr. Egan sent over here a trusty emissary, with
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P376"></a>376}</span>
orders to report to me, and to see whether it would not be
possible to buy of Pigott the original of the Egan drafts, for
he knew his man, and believed (rightly) that he would have
no objection to sell anything that he possessed for a
consideration.  I sent this emissary to Kingstown, where Pigott
was residing.  The emissary told him that Egan wanted
these originals.  Pigott declined to deal with the emissary,
and said that he must be put in communication with some
one whom he could trust.  On this I told the emissary that
Pigott could see me at my house on a certain evening.  I
went down to the Commission which was sitting on that
day, and informed Mr. Parnell and Mr. Lewis of what had
been arranged.  It was agreed that they should both be
present."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Labouchere's letter to Pigott making the appointment
for this interview has, with its hint to come "by
the underground," been so often referred to that it is worth
while giving it here in full:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
24 GROSVENOR GARDENS, S.W., Oct. 25, 1888.
</p>

<p class="quote">
DEAR SIR,&mdash;-I shall be here at 10 o'clock to-morrow morning,
and shall be happy to see you for a confidential conversation,
which, as you say, can do no harm, if it does no good.  I will
return you your letter when you come.  I think this house would
be the best place, for it certainly is not watched, and it would be as
easy to throw off any one coming here as going elsewhere.  Your
best plan would be, I should think, to take the underground, and
get out at Victoria Station.  The house is close by.&mdash;Yours
faithfully,
</p>

<p class="quote">
H. LABOUCHERE.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
It may be mentioned in parenthesis that Mr. Labouchere
had misdated his letter.  It was really written, as was proved
by the postmark on the envelope, on October 24, and the
interview took place on that evening at 10 o'clock, as he
changed the time of the appointment by telegram.
</p>

<p>
Both Mr. Labouchere and Pigott were very well aware
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P377"></a>377}</span>
that 24 Grosvenor Gardens, if not being watched at the
moment when the above letter was penned, would be so as
soon as Pigott was inside it, for the unhappy forger was
dogged in all his footsteps by the <i>Times</i> agents.
Mr. Labouchere had, however, nothing to fear, and poor Pigott
had very little to lose, and a vague expectation of something
to gain.  The upshot of the interview was that, in the
presence of Mr. Parnell and Mr. Lewis, Pigott confessed that he
had forged the letters and suggested that he would give a
full confession, and write to the Attorney-General and to the
<i>Times</i> that he was the forger, if Mr. Lewis would withdraw his
subpœna and let him go to Australia.  But it was not
Pigott's confession that Mr. Lewis and Mr. Labouchere
wanted.  It was the originals of the drafts of the Egan
letters.  Mr. Parnell and Mr. Labouchere withdrew to
another room, leaving Mr. Lewis to do what he could with
the slippery Richard.  "Soon," to continue the narrative
in Mr. Labouchere's own words, "Mr. Lewis came into the
dining-room, and said to me, 'Pigott wants to come to me
to-morrow and give me a full statement.  He is going away
and wants to speak to you'; adding, 'Mind, whatever you
do, don't give him any money; if you do he will bolt.'  I
left Mr. Lewis with Mr. Parnell, and went back to Pigott.
</p>

<p>
"That worthy at once came to business, and said that the
<i>Times</i> had promised him £5000 to go into the box, and asked
what I would give for him not to do so.  I replied that I
would give nothing, but that Egan's emissary had already
told him that, acting for Egan, I wanted the original of the
Egan drafts, as these would prove the forgery up to the hilt,
and that if he had them and they were satisfactory, I would
pay for them.  He asked whether I would give £5000 for
them.  When I declined, he asked whether I would give
£1000.  I said it would be more like one thousand than five,
but that I must first see the documents.  I then asked whether
the signature of the Parnell letters, which is at the top of a
page, was forged, or whether it was an autograph which had
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P378"></a>378}</span>
fallen into his hands, and he had written the letter on the
other side.  'Why do you want to know this?' he asked.
'Mere curiosity,' I replied.  On which he said that it was
forged.  He then left."
</p>

<p>
Nothing definite as to the original Egan letters was obtained
by Mr. Lewis when he called the next day, and neither
did he obtain the promised statement.  The interview with
Messrs. Labouchere, Lewis, and Parnell at Grosvenor
Gardens, and the subsequent private one with Mr. Lewis, were
reported to the <i>Times</i> agents by Pigott with a fanciful
account of what took place at each.  He shortly afterwards
returned to Ireland, and Mr. Labouchere continued his
efforts to procure all possible evidence on behalf of his Irish
friends.  He was considerably helped by his acquaintances
in America, who were able to furnish him with invaluable
details and scraps of knowledge about the various witnesses
for the <i>Times</i>, which came in appositely more than once in
Sir Charles Russell's masterly cross-examinations.  It is
interesting to notice, in perusing many of the curious letters
received by Mr. Labouchere at this period from Irish patriots
living beyond the Atlantic (what Mr. Labouchere had so
often heard from the lips of Mr. Parnell himself),[<a id="chap13fn17text"></a><a href="#chap13fn17">17</a>] how far
from popular Parnell was with most of them.  He was too
meek and mild for them, and they could not understand his
patience under injury and abuse.  In one of these letters
occurs the following anecdote about the intrepid Irish
leader: "I want to tell you," says the writer, "something
about Parnell in 1883&mdash;ask him: two men called on him
when he was in Cork and said (recollect the two were
extremists), 'Mr. Parnell, unless you give us £1000 for extreme
measures we will shoot you before we leave Cork.'  Parnell
simply replied, 'Well, I certainly have a choice, for which
I am obliged&mdash;to be shot now or to be hung afterwards.
I prefer the former.  You will never get £1000 from me for
the purpose you mention.'  One and all of these patriots,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P379"></a>379}</span>
however, at this crisis of Parnell's career were determined to
uphold him, and to allow whatever grievances they had
against him to stand over until after his political character
had been vindicated in the eyes of the hated English.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Labouchere remained in communication with Pigott
throughout the winter.  Pigott dangled before him the
possibility of further important communications, and on
November 29 Mr. Labouchere wrote to him as follows:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
As I understand the position it is this&mdash;Mr. Lewis holds that
we can prove our case against the <i>Times</i> in regard to the letters
conclusively, and this, you will remember, Mr. Parnell told you.
We prove it in a certain way.  You say that you wish to be kept
out of it, and not be called as a witness.  If such a course can
strengthen our case, and prove it still more conclusively, I do
not see why it should not be adopted, for the object is to prove
irrespective of individuals.  Evidently, some one must know
how you propose to do what you want, and what you say you
can do.  If you like to confide in me, I will tell you what I think,
and, if I agree with you, it will be then time for you either to
assent or dissent to Mr. Parnell or Mr. Lewis being informed.
But you are a practical man&mdash;so am I.  Mere assertion, neither
you nor I attach much importance to, without documentary or
some other clear confirmation.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Pigott answered as follows:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
  ANDERTON'S HOTEL,<br>
  FLEET STREET, E.C., Dec. 4, 1888.<br>
</p>

<p class="quote">
DEAR SIR,&mdash;I have arrived here, and write a line to ask you to
make an appointment, as I know that your house is watched&mdash;as
is also Mr. Lewis's Office&mdash;and as I am "shadowed" wherever
I go outside a certain limit, perhaps you could kindly arrange
that we should meet somewhere else to-morrow afternoon or
Thursday, or in fact any other day you choose.&mdash;Faithfuly
yours, RD. PIGGOTT.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
What occurred at the meeting which took place as
the result of the above correspondence is best told in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P380"></a>380}</span>
Mr. Labouchere's own words: "Pigott came about ten and stayed
till one A.M.  Again he explained that he had forged, and
gave me a good many details about the way in which he had
done it, telling me, amongst other things, that he had given
Houston three names as the sources of the letters, two of
which were efforts of his imagination, and the third a real
person.  He seemed rather proud of his skill, and by encouraging
this weakness I got everything out of him.  I asked
him how Houston could have been so easily fooled, and
whether he was an absolute idiot?  He replied that he was
clever up to a certain point, but thought himself twice as
clever as he was, and that these sort of persons are easily
trapped.  In this I agreed with him, and he told me that
Houston had told him that he wanted letters, because it was
intended to publish a pamphlet, and that the letters were to
be held in reserve to be sprung upon the Court if there was an
action for libel, adding that such an action would be certain
not to be brought.  Again and again, with weary iteration,
he came back to his plan to confess in writing, and then to go
to Australia.  I told him that he surely must be sharp enough
to see to what accusations this would subject me, and how
hurtful it would be to our case, which I assured him was of
such strength that it would smash him, quite irrespective
of anything he might say or do.  'Why, then, do you want
documents?' he said.  'Because,' I replied, 'the issue is a
political one.  We have to deal with prejudiced Tories who
have already compromised themselves by pinning themselves
to the genuineness of the letters, and consequently our case
cannot be too much strengthened.  With such people you
must put butter upon bacon.'  'What documents do you
want?' he said.  'Egan's letters, the original signatures
from which you traced those of Egan and Parnell, and a few
letters forged in my presence,' I said.  'I have not got
Egan's letters: I destroyed them.  I have not got the
signatures.  I gave Houston the letter of Parnell from which I
took his signature.  I will, if you like, forge the letters in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P381"></a>381}</span>
your presence.  I will give you the names of the three men
from whom I told Houston I got the letters, and I will give
you the letters that Houston wrote to me,' he answered.
I said that I would not give sixpence for these without the
two items that I had mentioned, and he reiterated that he
had not got them.  'Why,' I suddenly said to him,' did you
write to Archbishop Walsh about the letters?'  'The
Archbishop,' he replied, 'has not got my letters; he sent
them all back; to reveal anything concerning them would be
to violate the confidence between a priest and a penitent.'  'Well,'
I finished by saying, 'think it over.  I am going
out of town.  When I return, come and see me again, and
in the meanwhile try and find the originals of Egan's letters.
I will let you know when I come back.'  He said that he
would think it over, and, on wishing him good-night, I asked
him what he contemplated doing?  He said that he was in a
terrible mess, but that he saw no other course open for him
but to go into the box and swear that he had bought the
letters, and that if they were forgeries he had been deceived.
'You will be a fool if you do,' I said, 'but that is your affair,
not mine.  If I were in your place I should tell the truth, and
ask for the indemnity.'  'That is all very well,' he said,
'but on what am I to live?'  And so we parted."  Mr. Labouchere
did not see Pigott again until he saw him in the
witness-box more than two months later.  Pigott returned
to Ireland about the middle of December and the Commission
adjourned until January 15.  Patrick Egan had written
to Mr. Labouchere on December 2 from Lincoln, Massachusetts
saying: "I hope you will be able to squeeze the
truth out of Pigott in the way you say, as I should dislike
terribly to see him profit in any way by his villainy.  I do
not believe there is a single thing in the suspicion against
O'Shea....  The fellow is incapable of playing the role of
heavy villain.  I am quite convinced that the forgery part of
the scheme was the sole work of Pigott.  You will perceive
that all your injunctions with regard to secrecy have been
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P382"></a>382}</span>
observed on this side, but everything gets out from London
and Dublin.  Yesterday we had on one of our Lincoln
evening papers a cable (probably a copy of a New York
Herald cable) giving all particulars about the watch that is
being kept on Pigott and the discovery that C. is doing
detective work for the <i>Times</i>, that F. was mixed up with the
forgeries and other matters."
</p>

<p>
It must be borne in mind that, when the Commission
adjourned in the middle of December, the all-important
question of the letters had not yet been touched upon.  "The
objects of the accusers," says Lord Morley, "was to show the
complicity of the accused with crime by tracing crime to the
League, and making every member of the League constructively
liable for every act of which the League was constructively
guilty.  Witnesses were produced, in a series that
seemed interminable, to tell the story of five-and-twenty
outrages in Mayo, of as many in Cork, of forty-two in Galway, of
sixty-five in Kerry, one after another, and all with immeasurable
detail.  Some of the witnesses spoke no English, and
the English of others was hardly more intelligible than Erse.
Long extracts were read out from four hundred and forty
speeches.  The counsel on one side produced a passage that
made against the Speaker, and then the counsel on the other
side found and read some qualifying passage that made as
strongly for him.  The three judges groaned.  They had
already, they said plaintively, ploughed through the speeches in
the solitude of their own rooms.  Could they not be taken as
read?  'No,' said the prosecuting counsel, 'we are building
up an argument, and it cannot be built up in a silent manner.'  In
truth it was designed for the public outside the court,
and not a touch was spared that might deepen the odium.
Week after week the ugly tale went on&mdash;a squalid ogre let
loose among a population demoralised by ages of wicked
neglect, misery, and oppression.  One side strove to show
that the ogre had been wantonly raised by the Land League
for political objects of their own; the other, that it was the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P383"></a>383}</span>
progeny of distress and wrong, that the League had rather
controlled than' kindled its ferocity, and that crime and
outrage were due to local animosities for which neither
League nor parliamentary leaders were responsible."[<a id="chap13fn18text"></a><a href="#chap13fn18">18</a>]  The
Nationalists were impatient for the real business to begin,
for it was felt by every one that, if the letters were proved to
be genuine, the case was practically won all round for the
<i>Times</i>, whereas, if they proved to be forgeries, public
opinion on the subject could have but one bias.  Indeed,
Mr. Chamberlain himself had said: "To lead the inquiry
off into subsidiary and unimportant matters would be ... fatal
to the reputation of the <i>Times</i>&mdash;fatal to its success."  And
again, "If the <i>Times</i> fails to maintain its principal
charges, I do not think much attention will be attached to
other charges.  Any attempt, as it appears to all, on the
part of the <i>Times</i> to put aside those principal charges
or not to put them in the forefront will redound to their
discredit."[<a id="chap13fn19text"></a><a href="#chap13fn19">19</a>]  The delay, however, gave this advantage
to the Nationalist side&mdash;they had more time in which to
accumulate confirmatory evidence against the forger,
and the forger was given more time in which to further
involve himself, in the net which his fowler had spread
for him, by writing foolish letters and telling needless
lies.  Pigott had promised Mr. Labouchere to return to
London whenever he sent for him.  Parnell wrote to
Mr. Labouchere during the Christmas vacation of the
Commissioners:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
HOUSE OF COMMONS, Jan. 14, 1889.
</p>

<p class="quote">
MY DEAR LABOUCHERE,&mdash;I am anxious to see you before
your Irish friend returns to London.  Kindly give me an
appointment, and let it be if possible after four o'clock.&mdash;Yours
sincerely,
</p>

<p class="quote">
CHAS. S. PARNELL.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P384"></a>384}</span>
</p>

<p>
He wrote again as follows on the 21st:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
I do not think you need send for your Dublin friend this time,
as the <i>Times</i> will probably do that for you, and you will hear when
he is in London.  Another forged letter of Egan's was produced
in Court last week, and sworn to by Delaney, evidently one of the
Pigott series.  I am laid up with a cold, but hope to be out
tomorrow, when I will try and call to see you in the
afternoon.&mdash;Yours very truly,
</p>

<p class="quote">
CHAS. S. PARNELL.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The Irish friend was, of course, Pigott, and Delaney was a
convict&mdash;a witness for the <i>Times</i>.  He was one of the Phœnix
Park criminals, and was described by the <i>Daily News</i> reporter,
present in court, as of "over middle height, stoutish in build,
reddish-yellow haired, and with features which were more of
a Russian than an Irish cast.  He wore a short jacket of
check tweed, and a big white cravat about his neck."  He
had been brought up from Maryborough prison, where he
was doing his life sentence.  His brother was hanged for the
Phœnix Park murders, and so would he have been himself
if he had not confessed, and, in consequence, had his sentence
changed from execution to penal servitude for life.  He had
sworn to the handwriting of Patrick Egan on one of the
letters produced in court.  "Are you an expert?" asked Sir
Charles Russell carelessly.  No, Mr. Delaney was not an
expert, but he remembered the signature after so many
years, and he identified it when he was shown it "yesterday
evening" by the <i>Times</i> agent.  He was able to identify it
because Carey, seven or eight years ago, showed him three
of Mr. Egan's letters.[<a id="chap13fn20text"></a><a href="#chap13fn20">20</a>]
</p>

<p>
Pigott had been subpœnaed by the <i>Times</i> as a witness early
in December.  On January 24, Mr. Labouchere wrote to him
saying: "I see that Sir R. Webster talks about soon getting
to the letters.  When are you likely to be over?  If you wish
it, I will send your expenses to come over."  At the end of
the month he sent Pigott £10.  Labouchere's letter and the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P385"></a>385}</span>
£10 note were confided at once by Pigott to Mr. Houston,
who handed them over to Mr. Soames, and, of course, they
were produced in court and a rather different interpretation
put upon them to the one the recipient knew was warranted.
</p>

<p>
Pigott was not called into the witness-box, the ordeal
which he so justly dreaded, until the fifty-fourth day of the
Commission's sittings.  He at once gave an account of the
way he had obtained the first batch of incriminating letters.
It read like a romance, as indeed, it was in every sense of
the word&mdash;how Mr. Houston had begged him, if possible, to
find some authentic documents to substantiate accusations
against the Irish leaders, how he had set forth for Lausanne,
all his expenses handsomely paid, and had met there an old
friend who had told him about a letter written by Parnell
which was in Paris, and might be obtained; how he had then
proceeded to Paris and by a marvellous stroke of good luck
had run up against an Irishman in the street who was able
to give him more details about the Parnell letter, and other
documents of a similar kind, which had been found in a black
bag in a Paris lodging-house.  He had not immediately
bought the bag and its contents, because there were many
difficulties in the way, but he had gone back to London and
told Mr. Houston the whole story, and returned to Paris
ready to clinch the bargain.  But the Irish friend was not
easy to bring to terms.  He said Pigott must, before he could
get possession of the letters, go to America and obtain the
permission to buy them from the Fenians there.  To America
he accordingly went, and returned with a letter from John
Breslin to the Irish friend authorising the sale of the Parnell
letter (afterwards known as the "facsimile letter") and the
rest of the papers.  Houston came over to Paris and paid
him £500 for the contents of the black bag, and gave him
£105 for his own trouble.  It must be remembered that all
his travelling expenses had been paid, as well as £1 a day
for hotels&mdash;not a bad remuneration for a needy man such as
Pigott was, who, it turned out later, was making what living
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P386"></a>386}</span>
he could by the sale of indecent photographs and books to all
who cared to buy them.  Doubtless the black bag was useful
to him in his book and picture business, which was why he did
not sell it with its temporary contents to Mr. Houston.  The
said contents, as bought by Houston, were as follows: Five
letters of Mr. Parnell's, six of Patrick Egan's, some scraps
of paper, and the torn-out leaves of an old account-book.
The black bag was supposed to have been left in Paris by
an Irish patriot (Frank Byrne or James O'Kelly) and had
been taken possession of by the Clan-na-Gael.  Subsequently
two other batches of letters were obtained by Pigott
in Paris, and likewise sold to the <i>Times</i>.
</p>

<p>
The Attorney-General, in the course of his examination of
Pigott, drew from him the following remarkable account of
his visit to Mr. Labouchere's house on October 24:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
<i>The Attorney-General</i>.  Tell us, as nearly as you can, what
passed between you, Mr. Labouchere, and Mr. Parnell, and if,
at any part of it, Mr. Parnell was not present, just tell us and draw
the distinction&mdash;what passed as nearly as you can: how did the
conversation begin?
</p>

<p class="quote">
<i>Pigott</i>.  I think, as well as I recollect, Mr. Parnell commenced
the conversation, and what he said was to the effect that they
held proofs in their hands that would convict me of the forgery
of all the letters, and he asked me, with reference to my statement
to the effect that I wished if possible to avoid giving evidence at
all, how I proposed to do that.  I explained that I had not been
subpœnaed by the <i>Times</i> up to that date, that the only subpœna
I received was the one Mr. Lewis had served me with, and it
occurred to me then that probably, if I could induce Mr. Lewis
to withdraw his subpœna, I might avoid in that way coming
forward at all.  Mr. Parnell was of opinion that that could not
be done, that Mr. Lewis could not withdraw his subpœna, that
I would be obliged to appear.  Then, I think, Mr. Labouchere
took up the running, and he was rather facetious.
</p>

<p class="quote">
<i>The Attorney-General</i>.  What did he say, please?
</p>

<p class="quote">
<i>Pigott</i>.  He made a proposition to me right out, that I should
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P387"></a>387}</span>
appear in the witness-box and swear that I had forged the letters,
thereby ensuing&mdash;entitling myself to receive from the Commissioners
a certificate of immunity from any proceedings, legal or
criminal.  He said that was his reading of the law, and Mr. Parnell
agreed with him that such was the case, that it was an extremely
simple matter; it was merely going into the box, taking
an oath, and walking out free.
</p>

<p class="quote">
<i>The Attorney-General</i>.  I want just to get this: did the suggestion
that if you went into the witness-box, and said that you
forged the letters, that you would get your certificate, come from
Mr. Labouchere?
</p>

<p class="quote">
<i>Pigott</i>.  Distinctly.
</p>

<p class="quote">
<i>The Attorney-General</i>.  What else, please?
</p>

<p class="quote">
<i>Pigott</i>.  He urged me, as a further inducement to do this,
that I would become immensely popular in Ireland, the fact that
I had swindled the <i>Times</i> would be sufficient of itself to secure me
a seat in Parliament to begin with, and then, if at any time I
wished to go to the United States, he would undertake that I
should be received with a torchlight procession from all the
organisations there.  Of course, I could scarcely believe that he was
serious, but still&mdash;&mdash;[<a id="chap13fn21text"></a><a href="#chap13fn21">21</a>]
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Here almost uncontrolled merriment burst out all over
the court, in which Mr. Labouchere himself joined more
heartily than any one.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
<i>The President of the Court</i>.  I must say, whether this is true or
not, it is not a fit subject for laughter.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
But whether the President would or no, it was impossible
to prevent constant ripples of laughter from breaking out
all over the court while Pigott was narrating his version of
the first meeting at Mr. Labouchere's house.  Pigott told how
Mr. Lewis had arrived on the scene, and had also denounced
him as the forger of the letters&mdash;"Mr. Lewis assumed his
severest manner," said Pigott.  He continued his evidence
after some further questions from the Attorney-General.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P388"></a>388}</span>
</p>

<p class="quote">
<i>Pigott</i>.  Mr. Labouchere beckoned me outside the door into
the hall, and he there said&mdash;I forgot to mention that in the course
of conversation I stated that I had&mdash;I do not know exactly
whether I said I had been promised £5000 by the <i>Times</i> or that
I had demanded it.
</p>

<p class="quote">
<i>The Attorney-General</i>.  One or the other?
</p>

<p class="quote">
<i>Pigott</i>.  One or the other.  So referring to that Mr. Labouchere
said that they were prepared to pay me £1000&mdash;that he
himself was prepared to pay me £1000, but, of course, I was not
to mention anything about it to Mr. Parnell or to Mr. Lewis.
</p>

<p class="quote">
<i>The President</i>.  One moment before you go further.  "He
beckoned me outside"&mdash;where was he then?
</p>

<p class="quote">
<i>Pigott</i>.  That was at Labouchere's house.
</p>

<p class="quote">
<i>The President</i>.  I know, but where was it?
</p>

<p class="quote">
<i>Pigott</i>.  Outside into the hall.
</p>

<p class="quote">
<i>The President</i>.  Was it a whole house or was it a flat?
</p>

<p class="quote">
<i>Pigott</i>.  It is a whole house.  He took me into the entrance
hall, the room that we were in was the front room.
</p>

<p class="quote">
<i>The President</i>.  A dining-room or library or what?
</p>

<p class="quote">
<i>Pigott</i>.  A library.
</p>

<p class="quote">
<i>The Attorney-General</i>.  Is that the end of the conversation that
then took place?
</p>

<p class="quote">
<i>Pigott</i>.  Up to that time, yes.
</p>

<p class="quote">
<i>The Attorney-General</i>.  What did you say to Mr. Labouchere
when he said he was prepared to pay you £1000?
</p>

<p class="quote">
<i>Pigott</i>.  I said I thought it was a very handsome sum; I did
not say whether I would take it or not.  As well as I can recollect,
however, I raised no objection.  I took it that he understood me
to agree to that sum.  Then, on returning to the room, I said
distinctly&mdash;very distinctly&mdash;that nothing under heaven would
induce me to go into the witness-box and swear a lie&mdash;nothing
would.  Then Mr. Lewis explained to me the necessity for my
going into the witness-box might be avoided by the course that
he suggested: that is that I was to write to the <i>Times</i> to state
that I believed the letters were forgeries, or that I had forged them
myself, if I preferred it.  At all events I was to acquaint the
Manager of the <i>Times</i> with the fact that the letters were actual
forgeries, and that thereupon the <i>Times</i> would naturally withdraw
the letters, and the thing would drop, and of course Mr. Labouchere's
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P389"></a>389}</span>
offer would stand.  Well, Mr. Lewis did not say that,
but of course I understood it.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Pigott proceeded to give his account of his interview
with Mr. Lewis on the following morning.  He said that
Mr. Lewis had taken notes of what he (Pigott) said, and he
(Pigott) had told Mr. Lewis all he had told Mr. Soames with
reference to the hunt for and discovery of the incriminating
letters in Paris.  Mr. Soames's evidence, given in court on
February 15, of what Pigott had told him on this subject
differed very considerably from what, according to Mr. Lewis's
notes, he had told the latter.  For instance, Mr. Pigott told
Mr. Lewis on October 25 that he had sold the letters to
Mr. Houston, never believing for a moment himself that they
were genuine.  In court, on February 21, Pigott denied the
accuracy of Mr. Lewis's notes, made during his conversation
with him at Anderton's Hotel on October 25.
</p>

<p>
All Pigott's correspondence with Mr. Lewis and Mr. Labouchere
was then read out in court, with the replies of
the two gentlemen to Mr. Pigott.  The Attorney-General
ended his examination as follows:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<i>The Attorney-General</i>.  The only other matter I want to put
to you is this: these gentlemen told you&mdash;Mr. Parnell and
Mr. Labouchere&mdash;that they had copies of letters, which they had
written to you?
</p>

<p class="quote">
<i>Pigott</i>.  Yes.
</p>

<p class="quote">
<i>The Attorney-General</i>.  From which it was alleged that you
had copied these documents?
</p>

<p class="quote">
<i>Pigott</i>.  Yes.
</p>

<p class="quote">
<i>The Attorney-General</i>.  Did they produce any to you?
</p>

<p class="quote">
<i>Pigott</i>.  No.
</p>

<p class="quote">
<i>The Attorney-General</i>.  Did they at any time, either at
Mr. Lewis's office or at Mr. Labouchere's, offer to show you any of
them?
</p>

<p class="quote">
<i>Pigott</i>.  No.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
As the Attorney-General, rearranging his gown, was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P390"></a>390}</span>
slowly resuming his seat, a loud murmur of conversation
broke out over the court.  It stopped suddenly.  Scarcely
was the Attorney-General seated when Sir Charles Russell
stood bolt upright.  He had a clean sheet of paper in his
hand.  There was such a silence in the court that even the
fall of a pin would have been heard.  Pigott's little day of
peace was over.  Poor fellow!  He had done his best to keep
his share of the business in the black shadows where such
deeds are wont to skulk, but the gloom was about to be
dispelled by the light of truth.

CHAPTER XIV
<br><br>
THE COLLAPSE OF RICHARD PIGOTT
</h3>

<p>
Sir Charles Russell's cross-examination of Pigott
on the fifty-fourth and fifty-fifth days of the Commission's
sittings is generally considered to be one of the finest
things of the kind, from a technical point of view, ever heard.
A friend who was much with him at that time relates that, on
the day the cross-examination commenced, he was irritable
and depressed and unable to eat, and that he could not have
been more nervous had he been a junior with his first brief
instead of the most formidable advocate at the Bar.  But,
as he stood facing the forger, his whole appearance changed.
He was a picture of calmness, self-possession, and strength,
there was no sign of impatience or irritability, not a trace
of anxiety or care.[<a id="chap14fn1text"></a><a href="#chap14fn1">1</a>]  In the profound silence that had fallen
upon the court he began, in tones of great courtesy:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
Mr. Pigott, would you be good enough, with my Lord's
permission, to write some words on that sheet of paper for me.
Perhaps you will sit down in order to do it.  [He gave him the
sheet of paper he had in his hand.]  Would you like to sit down?
</p>

<p class="quote">
<i>Pigott</i>.  Oh no, thanks.
</p>

<p class="quote">
<i>The President</i>.  Well, but I think that it is better that you
should sit down.  Here is a table upon which you can write
in the ordinary way, the course you always pursue.
</p>

<p class="quote">
<i>Sir Charles Russell</i>.  Will you write the word "livelihood"?
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P392"></a>392}</span>
Just leave a space.  Will you write the word "likelihood"?  Will
you write your own name, leaving a space between each?  Will
you write the word "proselytism," and finally, I think I will not
trouble you any more at present, "Patrick Egan" and "P. Egan"
underneath it&mdash;"Patrick Egan" first and "P. Egan" underneath
it?  There is one word more I had forgotten.  Lower down, please,
leaving spaces, write the word "hesitancy" with a small "h."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Pigott, after he had written what he was told, handed
back the sheet of paper, and, as soon as Sir Charles Russell
had glanced at it, he knew that he had scored a great point
for Mr. Parnell.  The word that he had told Pigott to write
last, and with a small "h," as if that were the significant part
of the experiment, was the word which Pigott had misspelt
in one of the letters supposed to be from Parnell to Egan
which the Attorney-General had produced at the O'Donnell
<i>v.</i> Walter trial.  Pigott had again spelt it wrong.  Hesitancy
on the piece of paper which he handed back to Sir Charles
Russell was spelt "hesitency."
</p>

<p>
The cross-examination of Pigott occupied the rest of that
day, and before the end of it the wretched man had fallen
into hopeless confusion.  The production of some of his
correspondence with the Archbishop of Dublin (Dr. Walsh),
in which he offered, for a consideration of course, to avert
the possibility of a blow which was about to fall upon the
Nationalist party (presumably the publication of the
facsimile letter), almost finished his brazen self-command.  The
day's sitting ended in a roar of laughter, for Pigott's silly,
aimless reflections, elicited by the advocate's remorseless,
persistent questions, were ludicrous, and it was easy to see
what the climax of the affair would be.  The next day things
went worse and worse for Pigott.  A correspondence which
he had with Egan in 1881 was produced, in which he had
misspelt the word "hesitancy" as he had done the day before
in court.  Egan's answers to Pigott were not forthcoming,
for reasons which the forger made known later on, but the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P393"></a>393}</span>
drafts of these answers, produced by Mr. Lewis (who had got
them direct from Mr. Egan through Mr. Labouchere),
bearing a remarkable similarity to the Egan letters produced
by the <i>Times</i>, were read by Sir Charles Russell.  Copies of
letters written by Mr. Parnell to Pigott in 1881 were also
read out, coinciding word for word in parts with the
"facsimile letter" and the others put in by the accusers of the
Nationalist party.  Then Pigott was made to acknowledge
how he had blackmailed Mr. Forster, and Mr. Wemyss Reid
produced the Pigott-Forster correspondence in court.
Before the reading of this correspondence was finished, the
densely packed audience in the court, according to the <i>Daily
News</i> reporter, was wrought up to the highest pitch of
amusement and excitement.  The court usher had long since
ceased to cry out "Silence!"  The merriment was almost
continuous.  The judges themselves were unable to repress
their feelings.  A loud ringing roar of laughter broke forth
as Sir Charles Russell read one letter containing Pigott's
application for £200 to enable him to proceed to Sydney,
and some hints as to the pressure which was brought to bear
upon him to publish the Forster letters.  Mr. Justice Day,
bending forward, reddened and shook with laughter.  In
this letter Pigott wrote: "I feel this is my last chance, and
if that fails only the workhouse and the grave remains."  Poor
Pigott looked as if he would prefer even the grave to the
witness-box.  He changed colour; the helpless, foolish
smile flickered about the weak heavy mouth; his hands
moved about restlessly, nervously.  Then came the
climax&mdash;Pigott's letter to Mr. Forster, saying that he felt tempted to
reveal to the world how he had been bribed by Mr. Forster
to write against the interests of Ireland.  The notion of
Pigott's appearing in the character of injured innocence sent
the audience off once more into a fit of laughter.  It was now
four o'clock, and, in the uproar and confusion, Pigott
descended from the box, smiling foolishly.[<a id="chap14fn2text"></a><a href="#chap14fn2">2</a>]  That he had forged
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P394"></a>394}</span>
the letters no one now doubted for a moment.  The way he
had actually done it was not yet absolutely clear, but the
ingenuous Pigott was not going to leave any mysteries
unsolved.  The court was adjourned until the following
Tuesday.
</p>

<p>
The story of how the court met on February 26, and when
Pigott was called upon to enter the witness-box there was
no answer, and how it was subsequently elicited that he had
disappeared from his hotel on the previous afternoon and
not been seen again, has been graphically told by more than
one writer.  Who had given him the money to bolt, and
who had assisted him to evade the constables who were
supposed to be watching him, has never been positively
revealed, but the fact remained&mdash;there was no Pigott there
to tell the end of his squalid tale.  The court adjourned for
some thirty minutes, and then Sir Charles Russell made the
startling announcement that Pigott, without an invitation
from any one, had called upon Mr. Labouchere in Grosvenor
Gardens on the previous Saturday, the day after his
disastrous cross-examination, and had then and there dictated
to him a full confession.  This confession had been signed
by Pigott and witnessed by Mr. George Augustus Sala.
Mr. George Lewis, to whom Mr. Labouchere had communicated
the confession, had refused to have anything to do with
the document, and sent it back to Pigott with the following
letter:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
ELY PLACE, HOLBORN, Feb. 25, 1889.
</p>

<p class="quote">
SIR,&mdash;Mr. Labouchere has informed me that on Saturday you
called at his house and expressed a desire to make a statement in
writing, and he has handed to us the confession you have made,
that you are the forger of the whole of the letters given in evidence
by the <i>Times</i> purporting to be written respectively by Mr. Parnell,
Mr. Egan, Mr. Davitt, and Mr. O'Kelly, and that, in addition,
you committed perjury in support of the case of the <i>Times</i>.
Mr. Parnell has instructed us to inform you that he declines to hold
any communication directly or indirectly with you, and he further
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P395"></a>395}</span>
instructs us to return you the written confession which we enclose,
and which for safety sake we send by hand.&mdash;We are, sir, yours
obediently,
</p>

<p class="quote">
  LEWIS & LEWIS.<br>
  Richard Pigott, Esq.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
On the following day Sir Richard Webster made the
announcement to the court that a letter had been received
in Pigott's handwriting, posted in Paris, addressed to
Mr. Shannon, the Dublin solicitor, who had been assisting
Mr. Soames.  The letter had not been opened, and he handed it
to the President of the Commission, who passed it down to
Mr. Cunynghame, and asked him to open and read its
contents.  It was Pigott's confession made to Mr. Labouchere
and Mr. Lewis's letter to Pigott quoted above.  The envelope
contained also a note from the irrepressible Pigott as
follows:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
  HÔTEL DE DEUX MONDES,<br>
  AVENUE DE L'OPERA, PARIS, Tuesday.<br>
</p>

<p class="quote">
DEAR SIR,&mdash;Just before I left enclosed was handed to me.
It had been left while I was out.  Will write again soon.&mdash;Yours
truly,
</p>

<p class="quote">
R. PIGOTT.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The confession, as far as the letters were concerned, ran
as follows:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
The circumstances connected with the obtaining of the letters,
as I gave in evidence, are not true.  No one save myself was
concerned in the transaction.  I told Houston that I had
discovered the letters in Paris, but I grieve to have to confess that
I simply myself fabricated them, using genuine letters of
Messrs. Parnell and Egan in copying certain words, phrases, and general
character of the handwriting.  I traced some words and phrases
by putting the genuine letter against the window, and placing
on it the sheet of which copies have been read in court,
and four or five letters of Mr. Egan, which were also read in
court.  I destroyed these letters after using them.  Some of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P396"></a>396}</span>
signatures I traced in this manner, and some I wrote.  I then
wrote to Houston telling him to come to Paris for the documents.
I told him that they had been placed in a black bag with some
old accounts, scraps of paper, and old newspapers.  On his
arrival I produced to him the letters, accounts, and scraps of
paper.  After a brief inspection he handed me a cheque on
Cook for £500, the price that I told him I had agreed to pay for
them.  At the same time he gave me £105 in bank-notes as my
own commission.  The accounts put in were leaves torn from
an old account book of my own, which contained details of the
expenditure of Fenian money entrusted to me from time to time,
which is mainly in the handwriting of David Murphy, my cashier.
The scraps I found in the bottom of an old writing-desk.  I
do not recollect in whose writing they are.
</p>

<p class="quote">
The second batch of letters was also written by me.  Mr. Parnell's
signature was imitated from that published in the <i>Times</i>
facsimile letter.  I do not now remember where I got the Egan
letter from which I copied the signature.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I had no specimen of Campbell's handwriting beyond the two
letters of Mr. Parnell to me, which I presumed might be in
Mr. Campbell's handwriting.  I wrote to Mr. Houston that this
second batch was for sale in Paris, having been brought there
from America.  He wrote asking to see them.  I forwarded them
accordingly, and after keeping them three or four days, he sent
me a cheque on Cook for the price demanded for them, £550.
The third batch consisted of a letter imitated by me from a letter
written in pencil to me by Mr. Davitt when he was in prison,
and of another letter copied by me from a letter of a very early
date, which I received from James O'Kelly when he was writing
on my newspapers, and of a third letter ascribed to Egan, the
writing of which, and some of the words, I copied from an
old bill of exchange in Mr. Egan's handwriting.  £200 was
the price paid to me by Mr. Houston for these three letters.  It
was paid in bank-notes.  I have stated that for the first batch
I received £105 for myself, for the second batch I got £50, for the
third batch I was supposed to receive nothing.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I did not see Breslin in America.  This was part of the
deception.
</p>

<p class="quote">
With respect to my interview with Messrs. Parnell, Labouchere,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P397"></a>397}</span>
and Lewis, my sworn statement is in the main correct.  I
am now, however, of opinion that the offer to me by Mr. Labouchere
of £1000 was not for giving evidence but for any documents
in Mr. Egan's or Mr. Parnell's handwriting that I might happen to
have.  My statement only referred to the first interviews with
these gentlemen.  I had a further interview with Mr. Labouchere,
on which occasion I made him acquainted with further circumstances
not previously mentioned by me at the preceding interviews.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
There was a pause after Mr. Cunynghame finished
reading the extraordinary document.  It was an awkward
moment for the Attorney-General, but, in an extremely
dignified speech, he informed the court that, on behalf of his
clients, he asked permission to withdraw from the consideration
of the Commission the question of the genuineness of the
letters which had been submitted to them.  On that day
Mr. Parnell appeared for the first time in the witness-box,
and in answer to Sir Charles Russell's questions swore to the
forgery of his signature on all the letters in question.  There
was no attempt to cross-examine on the part of Sir Richard
Webster.  Mr. Labouchere entered the witness-box on
March 3.  He gave his evidence very slowly and realistically,
rather in the style perhaps of what Lord Randolph Churchill
described as newspaper paragraphs, but there was no lack
of connection in his descriptions of his various interviews
with Pigott.  When it came to the final interview on the
preceding Saturday the questions of the great advocate
became very close.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
<i>Sir Charles Russell</i>.  He came to your house?
</p>

<p class="quote">
<i>Mr. Labouchere</i>.  He did.
</p>

<p class="quote">

</p>

<p class="quote">
<i>Mr. Labouchere</i>.  No.
</p>

<p class="quote">

coming?
</p>

<p class="quote">
<i>Mr. Labouchere</i>.  No.
</p>

<p class="quote">
<i>Sir Charles Russell</i>.  Or had you asked him to come?
</p>

<p class="quote">
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P398"></a>398}</span>
</p>

<p class="quote">
<i>Mr. Labouchere</i>.  No.
</p>

<p class="quote">
<i>Sir Charles Russell</i>.  Now tell us what took place on the
occasion.
</p>

<p class="quote">
<i>Mr. Labouchere</i>.  He came in.  I did not catch the name
when the servant introduced him.  I was writing at the table,
and looked up, and saw him standing before me, and he said to
me, "I suppose you are surprised at seeing me here?"  And I
said, "Oh! not at all.  Pray take a seat."
</p>

<p class="quote">
<i>Sir Charles Russell</i>.  I said what&mdash;&mdash;?
</p>

<p class="quote">
<i>Mr. Labouchere</i>.  "Not at all."  Nothing would surprise me
about Mr. Pigott.  He sat down.  He then said that he had
come over to confess everything; that he supposed he should have
to go to prison, and he was just as well there as anywhere else.  I
said that he must thoroughly understand if he did confess, the
confession would be handed to Mr. Lewis, and that I must have a
witness.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Of the historic interview in Mr. Labouchere's study in
Grosvenor Gardens there has been no more graphic an
account written than the one by its only witness, the veteran
journalist, George Augustus Sala:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
In February 1889 [he wrote] I was the occupant of a fiat in
Victoria Street, Westminster, and one Saturday, between one and
two P.M., a knock came at my study door, and I was handed a
letter which had been brought in hot haste by a servant who was
instructed to wait for an answer.  The missive was of the briefest
possible kind, and was from my near neighbour Mr. Henry
Labouchere, M.P., whose house was then at 24 Grosvenor
Gardens.  The note ran thus: "Can you leave everything and come
here at once?  Most important business.&mdash;H.L."  I told the
servant that I would be in Grosvenor Gardens within a quarter of
an hour, and, ere that time had expired, I was ushered into a large
library on the ground floor, where I found the senior member for
Northampton smoking his sempiternal cigarette, but with an
unusual and curious expression of animation on his normally
passive countenance.
</p>

<p class="quote">
He was not alone.  Ensconced in a roomy fauteuil, a few
paces from Mr. Labouchere's writing-table, there was a somewhat
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P399"></a>399}</span>
burly individual of middle stature and more than middle age.
He looked fully sixty, although I have been given to understand
that his age did not exceed fifty-five; but his elderly aspect was
enhanced by his baldness, which revealed a large amount of oval
<i>os frontis</i> fringed by grey locks.  The individual had an eyeglass
screwed into one eye, and he was using this optical aid most
assiduously; for he was poring over a copy of that morning's
issue of the <i>Times</i>, going right down one column and apparently
up it again; then taking column after column in succession; then
harking back as though he had omitted some choice paragraph;
and then resuming the sequence of his lecture, ever and anon
tapping that ovoid frontal bone of his, as though to evoke
memories of the past, with a little silver pencil-case.  I noted his
somewhat shabby genteel attire, and, in particular, I observed
that the hand which held the copy of the <i>Times</i> never ceased to
shake.  Mr. Labouchere, in his most courteous manner and his
blandest tone, said, "Allow me to introduce you to a gentleman
of whom you must have heard a great deal, Mr.&mdash;&mdash;."  I
replied, "There is not the slightest necessity for naming him.  I
know him well enough.  That's Mr. Pigott."
</p>

<p class="quote">
The individual in the capacious fauteuil wriggled from
behind the <i>Times</i> an uneasy acknowledgment of my recognition;
but if anything could be conducive to putting completely at his
ease a gentleman who, from some cause or another, was troubled
in his mind, it would have been the dulcet voice in which
Mr. Labouchere continued: "The fact is that Mr. Pigott has come
here, quite unsolicited, to make a full confession.  I told him that
I would listen to nothing he had to say, save in the presence of a
witness, and, remembering that you lived close by, I thought that
you would not mind coming here and listening to what Mr. Pigott
has to confess, which will be taken down, word by word, from his
dictation in writing."  It has been my lot during a long and
diversified career to have to listen to a large number of very queer
statements from very queer people; and, by dint of experience,
you reach at last a stage of stoicism when little, if anything, that
is imparted to you excites surprise.  Mr. Pigott, although he
had screwed his courage to the sticking place of saying that he
was going to confess, manifested considerable tardiness in orally
"owning up."  Conscience, we were justified in assuming, had
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P400"></a>400}</span>
gnawed to an extent sufficient to make him disposed to relieve his
soul from a dreadful burden; but conscience, to all seeming, had
to gnaw a little longer and a little more sharply ere he absolutely
gave tongue.  So we let him be for about ten minutes.
Mr. Labouchere kindled another cigarette.  I lighted a cigar.
</p>

<p class="quote">
At length Mr. Pigott stood up and came forward into the
light, by the side of Mr. Labouchere's writing-table.  He did
not change colour; he did not blench; but when&mdash;out of the
fulness of his heart, no doubt&mdash;his mouth spake, it was in a low,
half-musing tone, more at first as though he were talking to
himself than to any auditors.  By degrees, however, his voice
rose, his diction became more fluent.  It is only necessary that,
in this place, I should say that, in substance, Pigott confessed
that he had forged the letters alleged to have been written by
Mr. Parnell; and he minutely described the manner in which he,
and he alone, had executed the forgeries in question.  Whether
the man with the bald head and the eyeglass in the library at
Grosvenor Gardens was telling the truth or was uttering another
batch of infernal lies it is not for me to determine.  No pressure
was put upon him, no leading questions were asked him, and he
went on quietly and continuously to the end of a story which I
should have thought amazing had I not had occasion to hear
many more tales even more astounding.  He was not voluble,
but he was collected, clear, and coherent; nor, although he
repeatedly confessed to forgery, fraud, deception, and
misrepresentation, did he seem overcome with anything approaching active
shame.  His little peccadilloes were plainly owned, but he
appeared to treat them more as incidental weakness than as
extraordinary acts of wickedness.
</p>

<p class="quote">
When he had come to the end of his statement Mr. Labouchere
left the library for a few minutes to obtain a little refreshment.
It was a great relief to me when he came back, for, when Pigott
and I were left together, there came over me a vague dread that
he might disclose his complicity with the Rye House Plot, or
that he would admit that he had been the executioner of King
Charles I.  The situation was rather embarrasing; the time might
have been tided over by whistling, but unfortunately I never learnt
to whistle.  It would have been rude to read a book; and besides,
to do so would have necessitated my taking my eyes off
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P401"></a>401}</span>
Mr. Pigott, and I never took them off him.  We did get into
conversation, but our talk was curt and trite.  He remarked, first taking
up that so-often-conned <i>Times</i>, that the London papers were
inconveniently large.  This, being a self-evident proposition,
met with no response from me, but on his proceeding to say, in
quite a friendly manner, that I must have found the afternoon's
interview rather stupid work, I replied that, on the contrary, so
far as I was concerned, I had found it equally amusing and
instructive.  Then the frugal Mr. Labouchere coming back with
his mouth full, we went to business again.  The whole of Pigott's
confession, beginning with the declaration that he had made it
uninvited and without any pecuniary consideration, was read
over to him line by line and word by word.  He made no correction
or alteration whatsoever.  The confession covered several
sheets of paper, and to each sheet he affixed his initials.  Finally,
at the bottom of the completed document he signed his name
beneath which I wrote mine as a witness.[<a id="chap14fn3text"></a><a href="#chap14fn3">3</a>]
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The history of the Commission subsequent to Pigott's
disappearance does not belong to this biography.  It is
enough to say that it terminated its business on November
20, 1889, after having sat no less than 126 times.
</p>

<p>
On the 8th of March, eight days after his last appearance
in the witness-box, the news of Pigott's suicide reached
London.  It appeared that after his interview with
Mr. Labouchere and Mr. Sala, he treated himself to an evening's
amusement at the Alhambra Music Hall.  He left on
Monday morning for Paris, whence he posted the envelope
containing his confession and other enclosures to Mr. Shannon.
He reached Madrid on Thursday, where he put up at
the Hotel des Ambassadeurs, and spent the afternoon and
following morning in visiting the churches and picture
galleries.  He would not have been tracked so quickly by
the detectives if he had not sent a wire to Mr. Shannon&mdash;the
Dublin solicitor who had assisted Mr. Soames&mdash;asking for
the money "you promised me," which gave the clue to his
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P402"></a>402}</span>
whereabouts.  On the following afternoon, when he was
informed by the hotel interpreter that a police officer wanted
him, he retired to his bedroom and shot himself through the
brain.[<a id="chap14fn4text"></a><a href="#chap14fn4">4</a>]
</p>

<p>
Richard Pigott had one redeeming feature in his character&mdash;unless
his complete lack of self-consciousness in evil doing
be counted as another&mdash;an intense love for his motherless
children.  There were four of these.  Mr. Labouchere's
compassion for the wretched man had early been aroused
in connection with the really pathetic state of his domestic
affairs, and, although his "underground" relations with
Pigott prevented him from being able to promise definitely
to give him any assistance for his children in the event of the
<i>Times</i> or Parnell prosecuting him as a consequence of his
confession, it is easily to be imagined that Pigott would have
perceived during his visits to Grosvenor Gardens the
extraordinary tenderness of feeling that Mr. Labouchere could
never conceal where there was a question of any suffering to
be saved to a child.  In his examination by Sir Charles
Russell Mr. Labouchere had said: "Pigott said to me, 'I shall go
to prison, but perhaps I am better there than anywhere else;
the only thing I regret is the position of my children, who will
starve.'  I said: 'Well, I think they won't starve, or
anything of that sort, but if you want me to make any terms
about your children, you must not expect it from me.'"  Poor
puzzled Pigott!  He had done everything he could to
please every one round him, and yet he could get no one at
this crisis to do the one thing that would have set his
fluttering mind at ease.  No one would promise to befriend the
four little boys at Kingstown.  Truly, as he had told
Mr. Labouchere, he was in a terrible mess.
</p>

<p>
But as soon as the poor fellow was dead, and his motives
could no longer be impugned by the vigilant Tories,
Mr. Labouchere set himself with energy to see that the children
were cared for.  He sent a friend to Kingstown to report to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P403"></a>403}</span>
him on the condition of the orphans, and she wrote to him as
follows: "I had a long chat with the housekeeper who is to
my mind an excellent woman.  A more self-forgetful
creature I never saw, and nobody ever wrapped truths in
softer garments.  She pitied her master.  She says that
Pigott adored these children, and that it was his desire to
give them comforts and education which drove him into such
crimes.  I do hope that something will be done for these
poor friendless children, to whom the father was a most
indulgent parent.  I saw lying in the room little toy yachts
and tricycles, bearing evidence that there was softness as
well as weakness in the character of the dead man.  The only
relative that the housekeeper knows of is an uncle, who holds
a good position under the Government.  She wrote to him
and got no reply."  A fund was started for the benefit of
the children, and in the pages of <i>Truth</i> Mr. Labouchere
pleaded their cause with eloquence.  In May Archbishop
Walsh wrote to him as follows:

<p class="quote">
DEAR MR. LABOUCHERE,&mdash;There are two ways in which effect
can be given to your charitable purpose.  The trust can be
executed direct through me, or I can arrange to have the matter
carried out by the parish priests of the place where Pigott
lived&mdash;Glasthule close by Kingstown, Dublin.  I may say to you that
two generous offers were made to me immediately after the
suicide.  One was a proposal to take charge of the two elder
boys with a view to their emigration to the U.S. or Canada, where
something would be done to give them a fair start.  The other
was an offer to take one of the younger children and practically
to provide for this little fellow by an informal adoption.
</p>

<p class="quote">
In both cases I pointed out that there is, I fear, a serious
difficulty in the way of my interfering in any prominent way in
the case, and indeed in the interference of anyone who is an
active sympathizer (as was the case in the two offers) with Home
Rule, etc.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P404"></a>404}</span>
</p>

<p class="quote">
The Liberal Unionists of Dublin who brought the unfortunate
father into temptation have a heavy responsibility towards the
poor children.  It is worse than mean of them to shirk it.  But
they not only shirk it, they try to throw the responsibility on to
the other side.  The insinuation made by many of them is that
Pigott was got out of the country by sympathizers with Mr. Parnell,
and that the suicide even may have been managed for a
consideration.
</p>

<p class="quote">
A very serious question then arises as to what can be prudently
done in the case of the children.  Of course they must not be
neglected.  But, so far as I can see, there is no present danger on
that score.  The two elder boys are at school at Clongowes, a
high-class school for lay pupils, conducted by the Jesuit Fathers.
Their schoolfellows have, throughout the whole case, shown a
splendid spirit towards them.  The two younger boys are safely
placed in charge of the former housekeeper in a place where they
are not known, not far from Dublin.
</p>

<p class="quote">
My advice would be to let matters lie until the school holiday
time comes on, about the beginning of July.
</p>

<p class="quote">
In the meantime I shall communicate with the persons who
made the offers of which I have told you.
</p>

<p class="quote">
When the case comes to be dealt with, I should suggest that
the best way to act would be through Canon Harold, the parish
priest.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Meanwhile should not something be done through the newspapers
to work up the call, which can be most legitimately made,
on the Irish Liberal Unionists to do at all events something
really substantial in the case?&mdash;I remain, dear Mr. Labouchere,
faithfully yours,

The statement of Dr. Walsh that there were people in
Dublin who insinuated that Pigott had been got out of the
country by the friends of the Nationalists seems almost
incredible, but it is a fact that, even in England, in country
places, lectures were given, under the auspices of the
Primrose League, to persuade rural voters, who might have been
reading the newspapers, that the forgery of the Pigott letters
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P405"></a>405}</span>
had never been proved, and even more ridiculous statements
were made in some places.  Mr. Labouchere wrote in <i>Truth</i>
on March 7:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
I feel it my duty solemnly to affirm that (incredible as it may
appear to Primrose Dames) I did not bribe Pigott to commit
suicide by promising him an annuity.  It is somewhat fortunate
for me that I can prove an alibi; otherwise I make no doubt that
I should have been accused of having been concealed in Pigott's
room at Madrid, and having shot him.  Well, well, I suppose that
allowance must be made for the crew of idiots who have gone
about vowing that the <i>Times</i> forgeries were genuine letters, and
who are now grovelling in the mire that they have prepared for
themselves.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Nothing can exceed my sorrow that we were not privileged to
hear in court the evidence of the expert in handwriting, Inglis.
So great, indeed, is my regret that I will willingly (if the <i>Times</i>
is in want of money) pay the sum of £20 for his "proof."  I have
always regarded these experts as the most dreary of humbugs,
and in this view I am now confirmed.  I myself subjected the
photographs of the <i>Times</i> forgeries to the limelight in a
magic-lantern, and I soon discovered that there were signs of tracing.
In some of the words&mdash;and particularly in the signatures&mdash;there
is a small white line, where the ink had not taken over the tracing.
If Inglis had done the same, he would not probably have made
so ridiculous a fool of himself.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
It must be owned that Mr. Labouchere made himself
exceedingly annoying in the pages of <i>Truth</i> on the subject
of the forged letters.  His taunts and scathing witticisms
at the expense of the prosecuting side and Messrs. Soames,
Houston &amp; Co. were almost past enduring, and more than
one apology was furiously demanded of him, to which he
usually replied by heaping more ridicule on the unfortunate,
writhing victim.  Some abortive attempts were made to hoax
him and make a fool of him as he succeeded so frequently
in doing of others.  In the winter of 1889 a somewhat
unpleasant case was brought before the Central Criminal
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P406"></a>406}</span>
Court, the only event of public interest connected with
which was the departure from England of a well-known
nobleman on the very eve of the day that the warrant was
issued for his arrest, and it was in connection with this affair
that someone tried to put salt on Labby's tail.  Whoever
the joker was he must have felt rather sold when he read
the following paragraph in the next issue of Labby's journal;

I have received through the post the following letter and

Another hoax practised on Mr. Labouchere came off,
and a considerable time elapsed before the perpetrator of it
was discovered.  He eventually turned out to be a member
of one of the most staid and respectable clubs in London.
Here is the story of the hoax, as Mr. Labouchere related it
in <i>Truth</i>:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
During the last few weeks I have received a number of anonymous
letters, all in the same handwriting, couched in terms the
reverse of complimentary.  Some of them were on the paper of
the East India United Service Club, St. James's Square.  This
did not trouble me, as I receive so many of such letters that I
am accustomed to them.  On Thursday last, however, my anonymous
friend sent orders signed in my name to a number of tradesmen
desiring them to send me goods.  He ordered two hearses
each with two mourning coaches, and requested a representative of
the cremation company to call and arrange for my cremation.  He
also ordered a marriage cake of Messrs. Buzzard, a bed of
Messrs. Shoolbred furniture of Messrs. Maple, Messrs. Druce, and
Messrs. Barker &amp; Co.; coal of Messrs. Whiteley, Ricketts, Herbert Clarke
&amp; Co.; Cockerell &amp; Lee; a coat of Mr. Cording, caps of Messrs. Lincoln
&amp; Bennett, a billiard table of Messrs. Thurston, prints
of Messrs. Clifford, carpets of Messrs. Swan &amp; Edgar, beer, spirits,
and wine from several firms, some of which was delivered, and a
vast number of other goods from West End houses, including an
umbilical belt for hernia from a city firm.  He also sent letters
to various physicians in my name, and they have favoured me
in reply with prescriptions for divers diseases.  He further
engaged cabins for me to India and to the United States.  Not
content with this he ordered a salmon to be sent in my name to
Mr. Gladstone, a Stilton cheese to Sir William Harcourt, a
travelling bag to Mr. Asquith, and a haunch of venison to Sir
George Trevelyan.  And he supplemented these liberal orders
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P408"></a>408}</span>
by issuing invitations in the name of a mythical niece to a party
at Twickenham and a dinner at my London house.  All this is
far more annoying to the tradesmen than it is to me, and I would
therefore suggest to my friend to revert to his old plan of anonymous
letters.  Neither of the hearses came, owing to representatives
of the firms having called to know how many men would be
required to carry my corpse downstairs.  Had the hearse arrived
it would have been curious, as the mutes would probably have
disputed in which I was to be moved off, and would have had to
appeal to me eating my marriage cake and arrayed in my
umbilical belt to decide to which I would give my preference.

<h3>
CHAPTER XV
<br><br>
MR. LABOUCHERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE CABINET
</h3>

<p>
There is no doubt about the fact that Mr. Labouchere
was always at his best when he was in Opposition.  This
characteristic was not peculiar to him, but was shared by
Sir William Harcourt, and, in a marked degree, by Lord
Randolph Churchill.  During the six years of Lord Salisbury's
second administration (August, 1886-August, 1892),
he stood out prominently as a man of ability and independent
courage in what was an extremely weak and inefficient
Opposition.  Always true to his Radical principles, he
protested ably whenever the questions of Civil Service
estimates were to the fore&mdash;the expenses incurred in the
removal or restoration of diplomatic and consular buildings,
or in the organisation of missions and embassies to foreign
countries, all the involved expenditure that is comprehended
under the term, so mysterious to the lay mind, of "miscellaneous
legal buildings," in the upkeep of the royal parks
and palaces.  The annual expenditure for the warming and
lighting of Kew Palace especially aroused his ire.  He had,
he said, hunted for the building and at last perceived over an
iron gate a tumble down, depressed-looking house in which
he could not imagine that anyone less insane than George III. in
his later years could be expected to wish to reside, and if
there were any such, they might, at least, warm and light
themselves without any application to the British taxpayer.
As for Kensington Palace, to vote an annual sum for its
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P410"></a>410}</span>
maintenance was merely dropping water into a bottomless
well.  It was dilapidated and useless.  Why not pull it down
or turn it into a large restaurant&mdash;an investment which
would certainly pay&mdash;and put money into the taxpayer's
pockets for a change?  Of course he should advocate that
only temperance drinks should be sold upon the premises,
but even with that restriction a profit would be certain.
Then he would attack the extravagance of the House of
Commons.  Oil lamps in the committee rooms!  Were
Ministers a species of patron saints before whom perpetual
lamps had to be kept burning in order to secure their favours?
Electric light had been installed in the House, and yet the
annual sum spent on oil lamps was undiminished.  Perhaps,
replied the long-suffering Mr. Plunkett, after the expenditure
on oil had been ruthlessly gone into and shown to be
superfluous, the hon. member for Northampton will soon be a
Minister himself and will then know the awkwardness of
attending in the House from three in the afternoon to one
in the morning and having to turn up or down an oil lamp
every time he went from one room to another.  In short,
Mr. Labouchere's obstructionary tactics were magnificent.
</p>

<p>
His speeches on the Triple Alliance were marked by an
intimate knowledge of European politics acquired by a long
and sympathetic frequentation of the best politicians in
Europe and as different as possible from the accumulation of
facts out of text-books which formed the mental equipment
on the subject of many of his colleagues.  The point of
departure of his first speech on the Triple Alliance was a
statement made in the Italian Parliament on May 14, 1891,
by a deputy named Chiala to the effect that the Italian
position was now secure by land and sea, English interests
being identical with Italian.  On June 2, 1891, he asked
Sir James Fergusson whether special undertakings were
entered into in 1887 between England and Italy of such
importance as to justify Signor Chiala's remark, which had
met with no challenge in the Italian Chamber, and he spoke
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P411"></a>411}</span>
with characteristic eloquence both then and on July 9,
against the renewal of the Triple Alliance, which obliged
England, he said, to side with Italy against France, under
the pretext of maintaining the status quo in the Mediterranean.
Mr. Gladstone wrote him the following letter on
the subject:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
HAWARDEN CASTLE, CHESTER, July 11, 1891.
</p>

<p class="quote">
DEAR MR. LABOUCHERE,&mdash;So far as I can understand I
think you have left the question of the Triple Alliance and our
relation to it standing well in itself and well for us.  If ever there
was a complication from which England ought to stand absolutely
aloof it is this.  I would take for a proof apart from all others the
astounding letter of Mr. Stead in yesterday's <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>,
who founds an European policy on the isolation of France still
perhaps at the head of continental civilisation.  I fear with you
that Salisbury has given virtual pledges for himself which in all
likelihood he will never even be called upon to redeem, and which
Parliament and members of Parliament may with perfect propriety
object to his redeeming.  What a little surprises me is
that the Italians should not better understand the frailty of
the foundation on which I fear they have built their hopes.
</p>

<p class="quote">
In the <i>Daily News</i> yesterday Mr. White says the alliance was
first concluded in 1882.  If so it was certainly without our
approbation, I think without our knowledge.&mdash;Yours faithfully,
</p>

<p class="quote">
W. E. GLADSTONE.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
In Mr. Labouchere's attacks on Lord Salisbury's Foreign
Office administration, he found many of the opportunities
which he loved of pouring ridicule upon the whole institution
of diplomacy.  He told the Committee, during the discussion
on the Foreign Office vote, how the service is recruited.
A friend of his, he said, who reached the top of his profession,
presented himself for examination.  Of the questions put
before him he could answer none, being completely ignorant
of the subjects upon which they were supposed to test him.
Great was his surprise when the results of the examination
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P412"></a>412}</span>
were made known.  He found himself not only passed but
at the top of the list of candidates.  "How can these things
be?" he asked the examiner when he next met him.  "Well,"
replied the great man, "we saw you knew nothing, but your
manner was so free from constraint under what to some
people would have been embarrassing circumstances, that we
decided: 'That's the very man to make a diplomatist,'
and so we passed you."  That this little anecdote was
introduced to the notice of Sir James Fergusson as a prelude to
Mr. Labouchere's bland explanation that, according to his
personal experience, Under-Secretaries for Foreign Affairs
and members of the diplomatic body generally were of all
men the most ignorant, did not rob it of any of its sting.
Across the Channel, Mr. Labouchere's abilities, where foreign
politics were concerned, were rated at their true value.  In
February, 1892, the <i>Voltaire</i> published a long article dealing
with the personality of this "remarkable man" and his
knowledge of European affairs, which concluded with these words:
"Mr. Labouchere is one of those grand Englishmen who do
credit both to the party which they defend and to the party
which they condescend to attack.  Moreover, shortly he
will be a member of the Cabinet, and Mr. Gladstone depends
on his co-operation to finish the last struggle with the dying
Tory party."
</p>

<p>
That Mr. Labouchere's name was not included in
Mr. Gladstone's Cabinet of 1892 was an omission that struck
not only European politicians but the public of England, both
Conservative and Radical, as curious.  Mr. Gladstone, who
had intended him to have one of the most important offices
in the Cabinet (not the Post Office, as has been so often
asserted), was himself taken aback, and so much so that
when he was made aware that the Queen would object to
Mr. Labouchere's name being submitted to her, he went the
length of privately asking Mr. Labouchere to write him a
letter stating that he should not accept office were it offered
to him.  Had Mr. Labouchere been under the necessity of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P413"></a>413}</span>
wishing to improve his political position in the country, there
is no doubt that this would have been his opportunity for
doing so.  Such a course of action would have appeared to
the superficial observer to fit in with his Radical principles,
and he could have pretended to his followers that he
considered his power greater below the gangway than on the
pedestal of office, and (a matter, however, which was of
supreme indifference to him) his enemies could not have
pointed the finger of scorn at him.  Incidentally, too,
Mr. Gladstone would have been saved from an imputation of
ingratitude to a follower who had stood by him, through
thick and thin, to win the cause that the Grand Old Man
had nearest his heart, to wit, Home Rule for Ireland, and
a follower, who, throughout a long and original political
career, had never once failed towards his leader in any detail
of the minutiæ that went to make up the etiquette of political
intercourse in the last century.  But, as Mr. Labouchere
explained to a near relative at the time, he couldn't stand
the humbug of the suggestion, and he would, moreover, have
been pledged to support the Ministry.  Besides, that the
Queen should have objected to him was not a surprise.
Nobody was able to appreciate better than himself, with his
tolerant view of human nature, the fact that tastes differ,
and to realise more fully that, in so far as personal feelings
went, he might very easily be a <i>persona ingrata</i> where Court
favour was concerned.  "So that the good ship <i>Democracy</i>
sails prosperously into Joppa," he wrote at the time, "I
care not whether my berth is in the officers' quarters or in
the forecastle.  Jones or Jonah it is all the same to me, and
if I thought that my being thrown overboard would render
the success of the voyage more certain, overboard I would go
with pleasure&mdash;all the more as I can swim."  But, in his
surmise as to why the Queen had objected to him he was
mistaken, and he did not know the real reason until several
years afterwards.  He imagined it was because he had so
persistently protested against the Royal grants, whenever
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P414"></a>414}</span>
they had appeared to him excessive.[<a id="chap15fn1text"></a><a href="#chap15fn1">1</a>]  It is difficult to see
why Mr. Gladstone, <i>having told him as much as he did</i>, did
not tell him more&mdash;to wit, the actual facts.  It would have
been perfectly straightforward and perfectly consistent, and
the explanation was one that Mr. Labouchere could have
accepted with dignity, and all appearance of a slight put
upon an eminent politician, by treating him as a nobody
to be passed over without any kind of justification, would
have been avoided.  The fact of Mr. Labouchere's being
the proprietor of and "chief writer" in <i>Truth</i> was the ground
of the Queen's objection, and if my readers have followed
the course of this biography with care, they will very easily
be able to imagine how early, and also how very reasonably,
the Queen's dislike to the publication had taken root.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Labouchere's jest about Mr. Gladstone laying upon
Providence the responsibility of always placing the ace of
trumps up his sleeve was a good one.  In one of his private
letters I find the quip worded a little more pungently.
"Who cannot refrain," he says, referring to the then Prime
Minister, "from perpetually bringing an ace down his sleeve,
even when he has only to play fair to win the trick."  Clearly
in the case of the exclusion of Mr. Labouchere from his
Cabinet, Mr. Gladstone had only to play a simple and
straightforward game for the trick to be his.  In fact, it
was his with the Queen.  There was no necessity for any
further ruse, and the matter would have ended.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P415"></a>415}</span>
</p>

<p>
Mr. Labouchere, still in the dark about the reason of the
slight put upon him, replied thus to one of his supporters at
Northampton, who questioned him as to the fact that he
was not included in the Cabinet.  He seems to have
made an effort to put the matter as well as he could for his
leader:

<p class="quote">
DEAR MR. GLADSTONE,&mdash;I beg to acknowledge your letter of
yesterday's date, and to thank you for its kindly tone towards
myself.  I had been away from home, and only got it when it was
too late to alter anything that I had written for this week's
<i>Truth</i> upon the matter, as the paper goes to press on Tuesday
at 12 o'clock.  I feel sure that you will recognise that I have
never asked you&mdash;directly or indirectly&mdash;for any post in your
administration.  I should indeed not have alluded publicly to the
the matter, owing to its personal character, had it not been that
the newspapers were discussing why I was not asked to become a
member of your administration, the implication being that I had
urged "claims," and that I resented their being ignored.  I
fully perceive the difficulty of your position, and, whilst I
cannot admit that the Sovereign has a right to impose any veto on
the Prime Minister that she has selected in the choice of his
colleagues, I admire your chivalry in covering the Royal action by
assuming the constitutional responsibility of a proceeding, in
regard to which I must ask you to allow me to retain the
conviction that you were not a free agent.
</p>

<p class="quote">
With respect to myself, it is a matter of absolute unimportance
that I am not a servant of the Crown, or&mdash;as we Radicals should
put it&mdash;an Executive servant of the Nation.  The precedent,
however, is a dangerous one, as circumstances might occur in
which the Royal ostracism of some particular person from the
public service might impair the efficiency of a Liberal Ministry
representing views not in accordance with Court opinion.  Of
this there is no danger in the present case.  My personality is
too insignificant to have any influence on public affairs, and I
am&mdash;if I may be allowed to say so&mdash;far too stalwart a Radical not
to support an administration which I trust will secure to us
Home Rule in Ireland; true non-intervention abroad; and many
democratic reforms in the United Kingdom.  My only regret
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P417"></a>417}</span>
is that the Liberal party has not seen its way to include many
other and more drastic reforms in its programme, notably the
abolition of the House of Lords and the Disendowment and
Disestablishment of the Church of England.
</p>

<p class="quote">
It will always be a source of pride to me that you thought me
worthy of being one of your colleagues, and that, in regard to the
incidents which rendered it impossible for you to act in accordance
with this flattering opinion, you consider that they testify to
my energy and influence, and are in no way disparaging to my
honour.
</p>

<p class="quote">
With the sincerest hope that you may long be preserved
as the People's Minister, I have the honour to be yours most
faithfully,
</p>

<p class="quote">
HAWARDEN CASTLE, Aug. 25, 1892.
</p>

<p class="quote">
DEAR MR. LABOUCHERE,&mdash;I cannot hesitate to answer your
appeal.  At no time and in no form have I had from you any
signification of a desire for office.  You do me personally more than
justice.  My note to you is nothing more nor less than a true
and succinct statement of the facts as well as the constitutional
doctrine which applies to them.  I quite agree with you that
men in office are the political servants of the country, as well as
of the Crown.  There are incidents attaching to them in each
aspect, and I mentioned the capacity which alone touched the
case before me.&mdash;Believe me very faithfully yours,
</p>

<p class="quote">
W. E. GLADSTONE.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
It would be idle to deny that the fact of not being in the
Cabinet was, temporarily, a very great disappointment to
Mr. Labouchere.  Faithful Northampton forwarded to him,
through the Executive of their Liberal Association, the
following resolution, the sentiment and kindly feeling of
which was appreciated to the full by Northampton's member:
"That this Executive records its warmest praise for the
brilliant defences of democracy put forth by the senior member
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P418"></a>418}</span>
for Northampton, and rejoices at his fealty to the ties of
party, notwithstanding the personal affront of unrequited
services; and, further, it is more than satisfied that, by this
tactical error, he continues free to serve the cause of the
people, in which in the past he has so signally distinguished
himself."  It was to Northampton that Mr. Labouchere
frankly expressed where the real sting of his treatment by
his party lay: "Mr. Gladstone handsomely testified," he
said, "that I had never asked for office.  It is, however, one
thing not to desire office, and another thing to be stigmatised
as a political leper unfitted for it owing to incidents which,
while testifying to my energy and influence are in no way
disparaging to my honour."[<a id="chap15fn2text"></a><a href="#chap15fn2">2</a>]
</p>

<p>
Mr. Labouchere spent his summer holiday as usual at
Cadenabbia, and his mind soon resumed its equable habit of
thought.  The return of Sir Charles Dilke to the House of
Commons had been a genuine pleasure to him, and he was in
constant correspondence with him during his holiday, which
he extended some weeks beyond its usual limits.  His letters
dealt largely with the, to him, all-absorbing subject of
the renewal of the Triple Alliance.
</p>

<p>
"Notwithstanding," he wrote on September 17, "the
excitement about the Italian workmen in France (which has
now cooled down) I very much doubt whether the King will
be able for long to keep going the Triple Alliance.  The
customs Union with Austria has not been a success, and the
taxes are so enormous that there must come a crash.  The
Socialists and the Anarchists are joined by many who
simply want to live, and who put down the heavy taxation
and the want of a market to the policy of the Government.
As for the Army, it is not worth much, as they have depleted
the line regiments of good men in order to form a few crack
regiments.  If the French were to play their cards well, they
might soon force the King into a friendly understanding.  I
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P419"></a>419}</span>
wonder when Parliament will meet next year, if it sits until
Xmas.  I suspect that our revered leader is angling to be
able to get south in January and possibly February.  If
he can he will dodge every question except H.R."
</p>

<p>
Another sentence from a letter to the same correspondent
I cannot resist quoting.  It is so easy to picture how very
much he must have enjoyed reading the German and Italian
papers to which he refers, for the details of the great Italian
statesman's policy were almost like spelling-book knowledge
to him.  "I have been amused," he wrote on September 10,
"at the comments of the German and Italian papers upon
Mr. Gladstone's declaration that Cavour would have been for
Irish Home Rule."  Here is another charming letter written
from Cadenabbia: "A man who is owned by a dog has a
troublous time.  I am owned by a child, who is owned by a
dog.  I have a daughter.  This daughter insisted on my
buying her a puppy which she saw in the arms of some dog
stealer when we were at Homburg.  My advice to parents is,
Never allow your parental feelings to lead you to buy your
daughter a dog, and then to travel about with daughter and
dog.  This puppy is the bane of my existence.  Railroad
companies do not issue through tickets for dogs.  The
unfortunate traveller has to jump out every hour or so to buy a
fresh ticket.  I tried to hide the beast away without a ticket,
but it always betrayed me by barking when the guard looked
in.  I tried to leave it at a station, but the creature (who
adds blind fidelity to its other objectionable qualities) always
turned up before the train started, affectionately barking
and wagging its tail.  The puppy, being an infant, is often
sick, generally at the most undesirable moments for this sort
of thing to happen.  When it is not sick it is either hungry
or thirsty, and it is very particular about its food.  I find
bones surreptitiously secreted in my pockets.  I am told
that they are for the puppy, and if I throw them away I am
regarded as a heartless monster.  Yesterday he ate a portion
of my sponge.  I did not interfere with him, for I had heard
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P420"></a>420}</span>
that sponges were fatal to dogs.  It disagreed with him, but
alas, he recovered.  I take him out with me in boats, in the
hope that he will leap into the lake, but he sticks to the boat.
I am reduced to such a condition on account of this cur that
I sympathise with Bill Sikes in his objection to being
followed everywhere by his faithful dog.  Am I doomed, I ask,
to be for ever pestered with this animal?  Will he never be
lost, will he never be run over, will he recover from the
distemper if fortune favours me by his having this malady?
Never, I repeat, buy your daughter a dog, and travel with
daughter and dog."[<a id="chap15fn3text"></a><a href="#chap15fn3">3</a>]
</p>

<p>
Mr. Labouchere did not return to London before the
middle of October.  The question of foreign affairs
interested him unceasingly throughout Mr. Gladstone's fourth
administration.  When the composition of Mr. Gladstone's
Cabinet had been published in the continental papers, many
comments had been made upon the appointment of Lord
Rosebery to be Foreign Secretary, and the <i>Temps</i> published
a pointed leading article on the subject.  It declared that
Lord Rosebery was regarded by many persons as the incarnation
of Imperialism and Chauvinism, but it went on to reassure
its readers by saying that after all, as Mr. Gladstone
would be so occupied with his Home Rule scheme and minor
social questions, the hankerings of the Foreign Office after
national glory would be suppressed.  In any case, it added,
Mr. Labouchere will, if necessary, criticise and protest
against dangerous ardour.  The subject of Uganda occupied
the English Parliament early in 1903, and Mr. Labouchere
moved an amendment to the Address to the effect that he
hoped that the Commissioner sent by Her Majesty to
Uganda would effect the evacuation of that country by the
British South African Company without any further Imperial
responsibility being incurred.  He gave an account of how the
treaty with the King of Uganda had been obtained, culled
from Captain Lugard's own report.  Captain Lugard
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P421"></a>421}</span>
arrived in the country, he said, with a considerable force of
Zanzibaris with breech-loaders and two Maxim guns.  A
warm discussion arose on many points.  Some of the chiefs
were for signing, but the King held back and giggled and
fooled.  He demanded time.  "I replied," reported Lugard,
"by rapping the table and speaking loudly, and said he must
sign now.  I threatened to leave the next day if he did not,
and possibly to go to his enemies.  I pointed out to him that
he had lost the southern half of his kingdom to the Germans
by his delay, and that he would lose more if he delayed now.
He was, I think, scared at my manner, and trembled very
violently." ... And so on.  The speech was one of
remarkable power.  Although it covers over ten pages of
<i>Hansard</i>, the reader's interest does not flag for an instant.
It was replied to by the Prime Minister with appreciation
and vigour.
</p>

<p>
On February 13 Mr. Gladstone introduced his Home Rule
Bill,[<a id="chap15fn4text"></a><a href="#chap15fn4">4</a>] and the speech Mr. Labouchere made during the debate
is his last utterance on the subject that I shall quote.  He
was true to his great leader to the very end, although that
end had been extended to a date far beyond the period that
might reasonably have been expected.  It was a remarkable
fact, said Mr. Labouchere, that in 1886 they were told that
Home Rule would ruin Ireland and the proof was that securities
had gone down.  They were now told that Home Rule
would ruin Ireland because securities had gone up!  As a
matter of fact, balances at savings banks had gone up
because of certain Land Acts and Rent Acts, by which a good
deal of money which used to go into the landlord's pockets
now went into the savings bank....  A matter like the
Home Rule scheme was necessarily very complicated.  They
had two islands, one a large one and one a small one.  The
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P422"></a>422}</span>
object of the Bill was to enable them to produce such a state
of things as would enable them to have a local Parliament
in Ireland dealing alone with Irish matters, and a Parliament
in England dealing with British local matters, and also with
Imperial matters.  It was very much like trying to put a
square peg into a round hole.  He quite agreed that the
angles of the peg would remain.  They could not get the fit
geometrically perfect, but the great object was to get the best
fit they could under the circumstances.  It must always be
remembered in this matter of Home Rule that they had to
choose between two alternatives.  After the Bill of 1886
the Unionists went before the country saying that there was
a third course, that of some species of local government.
When they got into power where was the third course?  It
entirely disappeared....  The Duke of Devonshire had
tried to terrify them the other night about the House of Lords,
that the House was going to defend the liberties of the United
Kingdom by running counter to the will of the people.  For
his part, he had never been strongly in favour of an assembly
like the House of Lords.  He could not understand why some
six hundred gentlemen should interfere with the decisions of
the representatives of the people.  If they did they would
find that additional force would be given to the intention of
the democracy to put an end to their existence.[<a id="chap15fn5text"></a><a href="#chap15fn5">5</a>]  It is
interesting to note that in this, his last Parliament, the
Prime Minister himself was converted to Mr. Labouchere's
views on the Upper Chamber.  When his Home Rule Bill
was thrown out by the Lords, and his Parish Councils Bill
maimed and emasculated, he came to the conclusion that
there was a decisive case against the House of Lords.  "Upon
the whole, he argued," says Lord Morley, "it was not too
much to say for practical purposes the Lords had destroyed
the work of the House of Commons, unexampled as that
work was in the time and pains bestowed upon it.  'I
suggested dissolution to my colleagues in London, where half
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P423"></a>423}</span>
or more than half the Cabinet were found at the moment.
I received by telegraph a hopelessly adverse reply.'  Reluctantly
he let the idea drop, always maintaining, however,
that a signal opportunity had been lost."[<a id="chap15fn6text"></a><a href="#chap15fn6">6</a>]
</p>

<p>
In spite of Mr. Labouchere's activity during the winter
of 1892-3 his health was not good.  He suffered from constant
colds and coughs, and his throat, too, was troublesome.
The desire for change was upon him, and his mind went back
to the happy days of his youth in America.  He would have
liked to be made Minister at Washington.  The idea had
occurred to him at Cadenabbia when some American friends
had suggested to him how popular such an appointment would
be on the other side of the Atlantic.  The climate would have
suited him, and, above all, the friction which was so
inevitable between him and the Cabinet would have been avoided.
Washington was quite removed from any of those quarters
of the globe where Mr. Labouchere's and Lord Rosebery's
foreign policy might possibly come into collision.  But his
desire was not to be fulfilled.  Perhaps naturally, Lord
Rosebery thought that his appointment to such an important post
would look rather as if he were trying to get rid of a formidable
opponent, or at least as if he were trying to bribe him
into silence.  His refusal to grant Mr. Labouchere's request
was unqualified, and Mr. Labouchere acknowledged the
repulse, with his usual philosophic calm.  "However," he
wrote to Lord Rosebery, on December 8, 1892, "as the matter
rests with you, and as you are averse to the suggestion, I
can only say that all is for the best in the best of worlds."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Gladstone resigned the Premiership on March 3,
1894, and Lord Rosebery became Prime Minister.  The life
of the Liberal Government was short, and Mr. Labouchere
soon found himself again in his native air of Opposition,
when his old interest in Parliamentary matters revived.  It
was a matter of common knowledge that Mr. Labouchere was
strongly opposed to the Premiership of Lord Rosebery, as
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P424"></a>424}</span>
anyone possessed of his strong Radical nature was bound to
be, but that he had anything to do with the snap division
which ended Lord Rosebery's Ministry[<a id="chap15fn7text"></a><a href="#chap15fn7">7</a>] is clearly contradicted
by an interview which was published in the <i>Globe</i> on
the very day after the fall of the Ministry.  The <i>Globe</i>
correspondent found Mr. Labouchere in the highest spirits
smoking his "eternal cigarette" in his study at Old Palace
Yard.  "What do you think of the present condition of
things?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Well," replied Mr. Labouchere, "I have only just become
aware of what happened.  I was sitting on the terrace
yesterday evening just about seven with Sir William
Harcourt, who was joking about the quietness of things, and
saying it was a dull day without a crisis, when the division
bell rang.  I said, 'Great Heavens!  What's that for?
I want to get home to dinner.'  With that I rushed into
the division with Sir William, and really didn't know what
it was about&mdash;you know you can get into the Lobby now
direct by a special door.  Well, having recorded my vote
I hurried off to the theatre, and didn't wait to enter the
House.  Of course, if I had known what was going to happen
I should have waited to see the row.  I heard nothing of
the affair until this morning, when I read it here," added
Mr. Labouchere, pointing to the newspaper beside him.
</p>

<p>
"I see," said the interviewer, "that you voted with the
Government?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes.  I want less cartridges&mdash;not more, and anything
in that direction gets my support.  As far as I could
see it was only a rag-tag division."
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean one of those dinner-time snatches, like
your House of Lords amendment?"[<a id="chap15fn8text"></a><a href="#chap15fn8">8</a>]
</p>

<p>
"Oh no, not even as good as that; just the swing of the
pendulum."[<a id="chap15fn9text"></a><a href="#chap15fn9">9</a>]
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P425"></a>425}</span>
</p>

<p>
The question on South Africa was soon to agitate England,
and all matters of lesser interest must be left now
to show the impassioned part which Mr. Labouchere played
in an affair which cannot be said even to-day to have found
its final solution.

regard the present cost of
Royalty as excessive, and it deems it,

any decisions that may be taken in regard
to this cost, when the entire subject

CHAPTER XVI
<br><br>
THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA
</h3>

<p>
On Sunday, December 29, 1895, an armed force
commanded by Dr. Jameson and Captain Willoughby
invaded the territory of the Republic of the Transvaal.
The object of the Jameson Raid was to combine with a body
of disaffected Englishmen, living at Johannesburg, in order
to upset the Government of the Transvaal, and, thereby, to
provoke the intervention of the neighbouring British
Commissioner, and so lead to the remission of the grievances of
the Uitlander population.  Such intervention, in the opinion
of those responsible for the Raid, was not intended to result
in the absorption of the South African Republic by the
British Empire, though this point has never been made
altogether clear.  The English in Johannesburg, the
Uitlanders as they were called in Dutch, failed, however, to meet
the invaders, and Jameson and his men were captured without
difficulty by the troops of the Republic, and were handed
over to the Imperial Government to be tried and punished.
Subsequently, a select Committee of the House of Commons
was appointed to investigate the causes of the Raid.  The
Committee, which numbered amongst its members
Mr. Labouchere, met for the first time on February 5, 1897.
The directors of the British South Africa Company,
Messrs. C. J. Rhodes, Jameson, Alfred Beit, Lionel Phillips, and
Rutherford Harris, were represented by Counsel.  Mr. Labouchere
frequently told me that he had never felt altogether
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P427"></a>427}</span>
satisfied with the composition of the Committee.  There
were not enough stalwart Radicals on it.  It was composed
as follows: Sir Michael Hicks-Beach, the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, Mr. Chamberlain, the Attorney-General,
Mr. Cripps, Sir W. Hart Dyke, Mr. Jackson, Mr. Wharton,
Mr. George Wyndham, Sir William Harcourt, Sir Henry
Campbell Bannerman, Messrs. John Ellis, Sidney Buxton, Blake,
Labouchere, and Bigham (now Lord Mersey).  Mr. Labouchere
found his chief support in Mr. Blake, but even he fell
off towards the end, and the member for Northampton
registered his solitary vote for the second reading of the
alternative report with which he wished to replace that of
the chairman.  The chairman's report finally adopted by
the Committee may be summarised as follows:
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
"(1) Great discontent had for some time previous to the
incursion existed in Johannesburg, arising from the
grievances of the Uitlanders.
</p>

<p>
"(2) Mr. Rhodes occupied a great position in South
Africa; he was Prime Minister of Cape Colony, and, beyond
all other persons, should have been careful to abstain from
such a course as that which he adopted.  As Managing
Director of the British South Africa Company, as director of
the De Beers Consolidated Mines and the Gold Fields of
South Africa, Mr. Rhodes controlled a great combination
of interests: he used his position and those interests to
promote and assist his policy.  Whatever justification there
may have been for action, on the part of the people of
Johannesburg, there was none for the conduct of a person in
Mr. Rhodes' position, in subsidising, organising, and
stimulating an armed insurrection against the Government of
the South African Republic, and employing the forces and
resources of the Chartered Company to support such a
revolution.  He seriously embarrassed both the Imperial
and Colonial Governments, and his proceedings resulted in
the invasion of the territory of a state which was in friendly
relations with Her Majesty, in breach of the obligation to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P428"></a>428}</span>
respect the right to self-government of the South African
Republic under the conventions between Her Majesty and
that state.  Although Dr. Jameson 'went in' without
Mr. Rhodes' authority, it was always part of the plan that these
forces should be used in the Transvaal in support of an
insurrection.  Nothing could justify such a use of such a force,
and Mr. Rhodes' heavy responsibility remains, although
Dr. Jameson at the last moment invaded the Transvaal
without his direct sanction.
</p>

<p>
"(3) Such a policy once embarked upon inevitably
involved Mr. Rhodes in grave breaches of duty to those to
whom he owed allegiance.  He deceived the High Commissioner
representing the Imperial Government, he concealed
his views from his colleagues in the Colonial Ministry and
from the Board of the British South Africa Company, and
led his subordinates to believe that his plans were approved
by his superiors.
</p>

<p>
"(4) Your Committee have heard the evidence of all the
directors of the British South Africa Company, with the
exception of Lord Grey.  Of those who were examined
Mr. Beit and Mr. Maguire alone had cognisance of Mr. Rhodes'
plans.  Mr. Beit played a prominent part in the negotiations
with the Reform Union; he contributed large sums of money
to the revolutionary movement, and must share full
responsibility for the consequences.
</p>

<p>
"(5) There is not the slightest evidence that the late
Commissioner in South Africa, Lord Rosmead, was made
acquainted with Mr. Rhodes' plans.  The evidence, on the
contrary, shows that there was a conspiracy to keep all
information on the subject away from him.  The Committee
must, however, express a strong opinion upon the conduct
of Sir Graham Bower, who was guilty of a grave dereliction
of duty in not communicating to the High Commissioner
the information which had come to his knowledge.
Mr. Newton failed in his duty in a like manner.
</p>

<p>
"(6) Neither the Secretary of State for the Colonies nor
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P429"></a>429}</span>
any of the officials of the Colonial Office received any
information which made them, or should have made them
or any of them, aware of the plot during its development.
</p>

<p>
"(7) Finally, your Committee desire to put on record an
absolute and unqualified condemnation of the Raid and of
the plans which made it possible.  The result caused for the
time being grave injury to British influence in South Africa.
Public confidence was shaken, race feeling embittered, and
serious difficulties were created with neighbouring states."[<a id="chap16fn1text"></a><a href="#chap16fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p>
It is impossible to quote even such a summary as I have
just given of Mr. Labouchere's Draft Report.  He began by
indicating the difficulties under which the Committee
laboured:
</p>

<p>
"(1) Your Committee decided, in the first instance, to
limit its inquiries into that portion of the matters submitted
to it for investigation having relation to the Jameson Raid.
</p>

<p>
"(2) A considerable amount of oral and documentary
evidence has been placed before it.  But its task was
rendered difficult.  Some of the witnesses, who were either
cognisant of the Jameson plan, or who took part in the
Jameson Raid, displayed an unwillingness to make a clean
breast of all that they knew, and in many instances witnesses
refused to answer questions that the Committee considered
might properly be put to them.  Lord Rosmead could not
be called as a witness on account of ill health, although
Mr. Rhodes had referred to him in his evidence as able to answer
questions, to which that gentleman was not willing to reply.
Documents of the greatest importance, in possession of one
of the witnesses, were not forthcoming,[<a id="chap16fn2text"></a><a href="#chap16fn2">2</a>] nor was an
opportunity given to all the members of your Committee to
examine him as to the statement that he had made in evidence
in connection with them, nor was he reported to your House
for contumacy, with a view to your House taking action to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P430"></a>430}</span>
overcome it.  It seemed probable from the evidence that
much in regard to the document had been stated to the
War Office, as a ground for its taking certain action with
respect to the officers concerned in the Raid.  But witnesses
from that office were not examined as to these communications.
Although these documents were in the hands of his
solicitor, who informed your Committee that Mr. Rhodes
claimed them as his property, and would not allow him to
produce them, no direct application was made to Mr. Rhodes
by your Committee to allow them to be produced.  Other
documents of a similar character were secured by your
Committee only after Mr. Rhodes had left the country.
He was not, consequently, examined in regard to their
or as tenor, to his action in respect to them.
</p>

<p>
"(3) Owing to these causes your Committee cannot pretend
to have become possessed of a perfect and full knowledge
of everything connected with the Jameson plan and the
Jameson Raid.  It has consequently only been able to weigh
evidence against evidence, and to deduce from what has
been submitted to it the inferences that seem to flow
therefrom."[<a id="chap16fn3text"></a><a href="#chap16fn3">3</a>]
</p>

<p>
He proceeded to stigmatise, even more severely than the
Report adopted by the Committee, the political conduct of
Mr. Rhodes, for whom, in private, he had conceived
considerable personal admiration.  In paragraph 25 of
Mr. Labouchere's Draft Report was this statement: "Your
Committee is, however, of the opinion that they (Messrs. Rhodes
and Beit) merit severe punishment.  Mr. Rhodes is a
Privy Councillor, he was a Cape Premier, and he was the
autocrat of Rhodesia when the conspiracy that your
Committee has investigated was in preparation, and when it was
sought to carry it out.  He deceived his Sovereign, the
Secretary of State for the Colonies, the High Commissioner
of South Africa, the Governor of the Cape Colony, his
colleagues in the Cape Cabinet, the Board of the Chartered
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P431"></a>431}</span>
Company, and the very persons whom he used as his
instruments in his nefarious designs; and he abused the high
positions which he held by engaging in a conspiracy, in a
success of which his own pecuniary interests were largely
involved, thus inflicting a slur on the hitherto unblemished
honour of our public men at home and in our colonies.
Mr. Beit is a German subject.  In conjunction with Mr. Rhodes
he fomented a revolution in a state in amity with us, and
promoted an invasion of that state from British territory.
These two men, the one a British statesman, the other a
financier of German nationality, disgraced the good name
of England, which it ought to be the object of all Englishmen
to maintain pure and undefiled."
</p>

<p>
The only other important point in Mr. Labouchere's
Draft Report was that referring to the alleged complicity
of the Colonial Office in the Raid.  While Mr. Labouchere
admitted that the evidence in no way showed that any such
complicity had existed, he regretted that the question had not
been probed to the bottom, "because the slightest appearance
of any indisposition to do this by your Committee may lead
some persons erroneously to suppose that there may be some
truth in the statements of witnesses connected with the Jameson
plan that the secret aims of Mr. Rhodes were more or less
clearly revealed to Mr. Chamberlain and to Mr. Fairfield."
</p>

<p>
He expressed himself very strongly in the following article
on the Chartered Company in <i>Truth</i>:
</p>

<p class="quote">
If the events of the past week have not opened the eyes of
Englishmen at large to the character of the patriots and heroes
who have too long ruled the roost in South Africa, our boasted
national common sense must indeed be a pitiful sham.  What is
the position?  The South African Republic is a state originally
brought into existence by the Boers treking from Cape Colony
into the wilderness, and establishing themselves beyond what
were then the limits of British colonisation.  We tricked them
once into surrendering their independence, merely reserving
a suzerainty as against their right to conclude treaties with foreign
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P432"></a>432}</span>
states without our consent.  But since that was done, gold was
discovered within their territory, and this has led to the
migration of a vast number of English and men of other nationalities
into the region where the Boer imagined that he was safe from
pursuit.  On the whole, these settlers, considering how unwelcome
their presence must have been, have not been badly treated.
The taxation is not excessive, and the condition of the mining
industry is infinitely better than it is ever likely to be under
the Chartered Company.  Out of all those who have dabbled in
Transvaal mining shares during the last year I wonder how many
know the facts respecting the relation of the companies to the
Government of the country.  The Government charges on every
mining claim a ground rent or royalty of 10s. a month.  To a
company owning fifty claims this means a ground rent of £300
a year&mdash;a very reasonable charge, when from thirty to sixty per
cent. can be earned on the capital of the Company.  As against
this what do the Chartered Company charge?  One half the net
profits of all mines worked under their jurisdiction.  This alone
should teach shareholders of the Transvaal mines how little they
have to gain from the overthrow of Boer Government by the
Rhodes gang, and how thankful they may be for the course of
events last week.
</p>

<p class="quote">
The non-Boer population, however, at Johannesburg and
elsewhere have a genuine grievance on the question of the franchise
and other rights of citizenship.  In order to maintain their
exclusive sovereignty in the land the Boers insist upon a fifteen
years' residence for full naturalisation....  The period is
too long, and it would be prudent on the part of the Boers to
reduce it.  There is no reason to suppose that they would refuse
to do so, were the demands of the Uitlanders advanced in a
regular manner....  But even were the Boers ever so deaf
to justice and so blind to their own interests as to meet the
Uitlander case with an obstinate <i>non possumus</i>, what pretext
does this afford for armed intervention by the Chartered
Company?  A pretence it is true has been made that, before
commencing their Raid, Jameson and his men resigned their positions
under the Company; but even if such a form were gone through,
it is obviously only a colourable pretence.  The invading force
was drilled, armed, and maintained by the Company.  At its
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P433"></a>433}</span>
head was the administrator of the Company.  On his staff was
the Company's generalissimo.  It took with it the ammunition,
equipment, and horses of the Company....  Neither in the
political aims of the Uitlanders, nor the position of the
Johannesburgers was there a shadow of justification for Jameson's
Raid.....  The proceedings bear their character on their face
and are of a piece with all that has gone before in the history of
the Company.  The design was to play the Matabele coup again
on a bigger field.  What was the origin of the Raid on Lobengula?
The Company had obtained Lobengula's permission to occupy
Mashonaland and dig there for gold, and had no further right
beyond this.  When occupied, Mashonaland was found to have
no paying gold.  The shares of the Company were unsalable
rubbish.  A pretext was therefore found for making war on Lobengula
and seizing Matabeleland&mdash;a pretext as transparently dishonest
as the pretext for the invasion of the Transvaal.  All the
circumstances showed in that case as in this, that the coup had
been carefully prepared long beforehand.  When the train had
been laid, a quarrel was picked with the Matabele, who had entered
Mashonaland at the Company's request, and they were attacked
and shot down by this same Jameson while doing their best to
retire in obedience to his orders.  Instantly the whole of the
Company's forces, all held in readiness, entered Matabeleland
under the pretence that the Matabele and not the Company were
the aggressors.  Lobengula's savages were mowed down by
thousands with Maxims.  Those who were taken prisoners were
killed off to save trouble.  The envoys sent by the King to try
and make terms were barbarously murdered.  The King himself
fled and died before he could be captured.  His territory and the
flocks and herds of his people were parcelled out among the
Company and the band of freebooters who had been collected
by promises of loot.  One million new shares were created by
Jameson's principals and colleagues, and, in the subsequent boom,
shares were unloaded on the British public at prices ranging up to
£8 per share.  Matabeleland, however, has proved no richer in
paying gold than Mashonaland.  The shares have been going
down again.  What were the Chartered gang to do next?  In
the Transvaal there are extensive paying gold mines, and money
which the gang would like to pocket is going elsewhere.  Forthwith
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P434"></a>434}</span>
the Chartered Company's forces are marshalled again.  A
sudden and obviously factitious agitation springs up at Johannesburg.
Rumours of deadly peril to the alien population are put
in circulation, goodness knows whence.  The women and children
are packed off&mdash;so it is said, but no one knows why or at whose
instigation.  Simultaneously a message imploring aid from the
quaking citizens reaches Jameson, no one knows how, and in a
moment the fighting doctor and his bold buccaneers are once
more over the border.  There, however, all resemblance between
the two coups ends.  The Chartered heroes have not to deal
this time with naked half-armed savages, but with white men as
well armed as themselves, and as well able to use their arms.
There are Maxim guns on the other side this time and Krupp
guns as well.  Result: after a few hours' fighting, the conquerors
of Matabeleland are killed or taken prisoners, and the doughty
Jameson and his staff are lodged in Pretoria Gaol.  I have no
desire to exult over their fate.  It is a shameful and abominable
business all round, out of which no Englishman can extract a
grain of satisfaction.  But if ever men died with their blood on
their own heads, they are the men who fell in this raid, and if
ever prisoners of war deserved scant mercy, Jameson and his
comrades are those prisoners.  They may thank their stars that
they have fallen into the hands of men who are not likely to treat
them as they themselves treated the Matabele wounded and
prisoners.[<a id="chap16fn4text"></a><a href="#chap16fn4">4</a>]

He continued his attack in a series of articles.  The
burden of his argument was always the impurity of motive
arising from the financial interest involved.  "What a
comment on our morality," he writes on April 2, "has been
our action during the last few months!  We quarrelled with
the Americans about Venezuela about a bog in which we
fancied there might be gold; we remain in Egypt because we
are looking after the interest on Egyptian bonds, and finding
salaries for a herd of English employees; we are engaged in
a Soudan Expedition because Dongola is fertile, and its possession
will afford a plea to us to violate our pledges to leave
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P435"></a>435}</span>
Egypt; we are disputing with President Kruger because he
has fallen out with a crew of company mongers; we are
backing up a company in Rhodesia because its shares have
been put up to a high premium on the Stock Exchange.
But, pledged as we are to see that there is good government
in Armenia, we are supinely looking on whilst Armenian men
are being slaughtered, Armenian women ravished, and
Armenian villages burnt.  Why?  Because there is no
money to be made in protecting Armenians, and our
financiers have no interests in Armenia."[<a id="chap16fn5text"></a><a href="#chap16fn5">5</a>]
</p>

<p>
Mr. Labouchere thought, rightly or wrongly, that the
Imperialism of Mr. Rhodes was little more than a mask to
cover the desire for financial expansion.  Not that he thought
badly of Mr. Rhodes personally.  He thought that he
deceived himself in perfectly good faith.  While he detested
his aims, he could not help admiring the energy and skill with
which they were promoted, and something simple and direct
in the character of the man himself.
</p>

<p>
The estimate I had formed of Mr. Labouchere's opinion
of Mr. Rhodes as a private individual was recently confirmed
by the following extract from a letter which I received from
Mr. Charles Boyd containing a reminiscence of an interview
he had with Mr. Labouchere in 1897:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
That was the year [he wrote] of the British South Africa
Commission of which he (Mr. Labouchere) was a member, and
which, as George Wyndham's Secretary, I regularly attended;
he was, of course, very much "over the way," in Mr. Jaggers's
sense, to what one may call the Imperialist view of the South
African question.  It was, I think, in May, or, at all events, near
the end of the sitting of the Commission, that I conceived the
spirited notion of offering myself for the post of Imperial
Secretary to the High Commissioner for South Africa, Sir Alfred
Milner, then recently appointed; though without official experience,
I had some good backers on the strength of some little
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P436"></a>436}</span>
study of the South African problem.  Among these was one of
the kindest of men, the late Mr. Moberley Bell, manager of the
<i>Times</i>, with whom one morning I sat in his house in Portland
Place considering that forlorn hope, as it most properly proved
to be of my ambition.  "The only thing is," said Mr. Bell,
"what are you going to do with Labby?  You know you are
a child of the opposite camp."  I agreed with gloom that, if I
had any chance, and Mr. Labouchere "took notice," my antecedents
might not be a recommendation.  The imperial South
African Association was then about a year old, and active and
formidable enough to have caught the eye of <i>Truth</i>.  Mr. Bell,
leaning his big head on his big hand, had a benevolent inspiration.
"If I were you," he said, "I'd jump into the nearest hansom
and drive straight to 5 Old Palace Yard.  It's a sort of move he
may quite well love.  You will be 'squaring Labby,'" and
Mr. Bell dismissed me with his blessing.  Yet a little and somewhat
nervous-like I stood in the presence of your Uncle, in that wonderful
room which you will so well remember giving on the green turf
of the Abbey precincts.  I stated my case, and displayed one or
two testimonials, including that of his friend Sir Charles Dilke.
"And now," said I indignantly, "if I do have any chance, I
am told that I am in danger of <i>Truth</i>."  "Nothing of the kind,"
said Mr. Labouchere.  "I have, to begin with, a considerable
admiration for George Wyndham, and, as for yourself, your having
the nerve to come straight to me is sufficient proof of your fitness
for the Imperial Secretaryship or for anything else," and with
a graceful movement of his wrist he disengaged some cigarettes
from a sort of gilded network basket of the same, which depended
from the wall, and bade me sit down and smoke.  He talked of
the Commission, and asked me what I thought of the evidence
of Mr. Rhodes, with whom, of course, he had considerably crossed
swords, not to say whom he had bated.  I expressed, possibly with
an air of defiance, an extreme sense of Mr. Rhodes' candour.
"But bless you," said Mr. Labouchere, "I know all that as
well as you.  I like Rhodes, I like his porter and sandwiches.
An entirely honest, heavy person.  On the other hand, did you
ever see anything so fatuous as the performance of H&mdash;&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
Presently he returned to my candidature, and said, "I'd better
write you a testimonial myself, and that will allay your fears..."

<p>
As is well known, the troubles of South Africa did not
come to an end with the settlement of the Jameson Raid.
The aggrieved Uitlanders had not availed themselves, when
it came to the point, of Dr. Jameson's action, and their
unredressed grievances&mdash;that they suffered from serious
grievances was admitted even by Mr. Labouchere&mdash;festered
in their minds and produced, as time went on, deeper and
more widespread dissatisfaction.  Nor was the appointment
in 1897 of Sir Alfred (now Lord) Milner as British Governor
of Cape Colony and High Commissioner for South Africa
by Mr. Chamberlain, who had taken office under Lord
Salisbury as Colonial Secretary, calculated to allay the
resentment of the Boers, his Imperialist sympathies being
well known.  Towards the end of 1898, Sir Alfred Milner
left South Africa for England.  He was away for three
months, and during his absence several things occurred to
hasten the unfortunate crisis&mdash;the outbreak of war.  General
Sir William Butler had been selected to fill the chief military
command in South Africa, left vacant by the sudden death
of Sir William Goodenough.  Sir William Butler, immediately
on his arrival in South Africa, allowed his sympathy with the
Afrikander party to be very apparent.  He was convinced
that the English population of the Transvaal had no real
grievances, and were only striving to make mischief.  When Sir
Alfred Milner returned to the Cape, on February 14, 1899, he
was faced by a very different situation to the one he had left.
In almost all the towns of Cape Colony and Natal meetings had
been held by the Colonists protesting against the continuation
of the existing state of affairs in the Transvaal, and
demanding the intervention of the Imperial Government.  Dutch
feeling was no less agitated.  Among the extreme section of
Afrikanders everywhere a movement was on foot for the
formation of a National League which should bind together all
Afrikanders in strenuous opposition to any attempt of the
Imperial power to intervene in South African affairs.[<a id="chap16fn6text"></a><a href="#chap16fn6">6</a>]
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P438"></a>438}</span>
</p>

<p>
In England, the first indication of what was coming was
revealed to the discerning public who read Parliamentary
reports by the publication of the army estimates, in which a
sum not exceeding £1,211,900 was asked for to cover the
military expenses (March, 1899-March, 1900).  Mr. Dillon
asked why it was considered necessary to increase so enormously
our forces in South Africa.  The Colonial Secretary
(Mr. Chamberlain) replied to the effect that the Transvaal
Republic, which borders on the colony of Natal and Cape
Colony, had enormously in creased their offensive or defensive
forces within the last few years.  They had spent large sums
in forts, artillery, and rifles, and millions of cartridges had
been imported.  Therefore, as long as the British Government
was responsible for the peace in South Africa, a like
increase of warlike preparation was necessary on our part.
Mr. Labouchere replied aptly that the increased defensive
measures adopted by the Boers had only followed upon the
scandalous and outrageous raid which had been made upon
their country by the minions of the Chartered Company.
Then a paragraph appeared in the <i>Times</i> to the effect that
the Commander-in-Chief had been engaged in completing the
organisation and composition of the "larger force which it
will be necessary to dispatch to South Africa in the event of
the negotiations at present in progress with the Government
of the Transvaal proving unsuccessful."  Mr. Labouchere
asked, on July 7, whether the officers mentioned in
this communique as going to South Africa to organise the
forces, were to go into Cape Colony and into Natal to organise
them, and, if so, whether it was with the consent of the
Ministers of those Colonies?  To which question Mr. Balfour
replied "I do not know."[<a id="chap16fn7text"></a><a href="#chap16fn7">7</a>]
</p>

<p>
On October 17, Mr. Dillon moved an amendment to the
Address in answer to the Queen's Speech, praying for arbitration
to settle the difficulties between the two Governments,
so that "an ignominious war may be avoided between the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P439"></a>439}</span>
overwhelming forces of your Majesty's Empire and those of
two small nations numbering in all less than 200,000
souls."  Mr. Labouchere seconded the amendment, and pleaded
eloquently for arbitration, suggesting President McKinley
as the best arbitrator possible.  The peroration of his speech
was excellent, but, alas, it fell at the time upon ears already
eagerly alert for no other sounds than the music of triumphant
victory and glorious marches home after a course of
deeds of valour, which the mere fact of British nationality
was to render as easy of achievement as an afternoon's football.
It reads now with a different ring, and testifies to the
spirit of justice and temperance which were so characteristic
of all his policy in those crises when the English nation gets
stirred up, as it sometimes does, to a spirit of hysterical
enthusiasm, in comparison with which the excitability and
nervous agitation of the "foreigner" is a mere joke.  "I
confess that I feel very sorry for the end of these unfortunate
Boers," he said.  "They are fathers of families, they are
farmers, honest and ignorant if you like.  They are fighting
for that which they believe to be the holiest and most noble
of causes&mdash;their homesteads and their country.  We must all
regret that their country is not only turned into a battlefield,
but that a number of these men, the breadwinners of families,
will be slain.  For my part, I cannot accept the responsibility
of contenting myself with merely washing my hands of an injustice
like this.  It might be a very politic thing to say: 'There
is a feeling in favour of war; I protest against it, but I wash my
hands of it, and shall criticise hereafter the conduct of the
Colonial Secretary.'  I have not criticised the conduct of the
right hon. gentleman in this matter except indirectly, because
that is not the question of the moment.  The question is to
do the best we can to put an end to this war, and that is why I
have seconded, and why I would venture to urge the House
to agree to the amendment which has been moved, because
then the war would cease in a very few days."[<a id="chap16fn8text"></a><a href="#chap16fn8">8</a>]
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P440"></a>440}</span>
</p>

<p>
On October 20, Mr. Labouchere pointed out that, although
the total cost of our army is £22,000,000, we are "positively
spending £10,000,000 in sending troops to South Africa."  He
added, with some truth, that, as the Government had a
majority, to ask the House to vote against these proceedings
was useless.  But he declared that, in his opinion, before
the war was over, it would cost the country a hundred
millions.  A burst of laughter and ironical cheering from the
Ministerialists greeted the statement of the member for
Northampton.  They all imagined that Buller would be in
Pretoria before Christmas, and that there would even be
some change out of the ten millions voted.  What a chill
would have fallen over that light-hearted assembly if some
hand had written on the wall at that moment the real sum
which the South African enterprise so gaily entered upon
would cost the nation!  Something well over two hundred
millions did not cover it.[<a id="chap16fn9text"></a><a href="#chap16fn9">9</a>]
</p>

<p>
In March 1900, the War Loan Bill raising a sum of thirty-five
millions was passed through both Houses of Parliament.
The events of the war which had taken place by this time
were, briefly, these: The British dispatch which led up to
the Boer ultimatum was presented in Pretoria on September
25, and the mobilisation of the Boers commenced on the 27th.
The Transvaal ultimatum was presented to the British agent
on October 9, and the war began upon the 11th.  At the
end of the first fortnight the English claimed the victories
of Talana and Elandslaagte, whilst the Boers could boast
that they had swept the whole of Natal down to Ladysmith.
At Pretoria there was great jubilation, and the highest
expectations of success for the farmers' arms were
entertained.  Before Christmas the defeats of Nicholson's Nek,
Stormberg, Magersfontein, and Colenso had plunged England
into depths of gloom.  The investment of Ladysmith
had been completed, and the first stage of the war marked by
the advance of the Boers into British territory was over.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P441"></a>441}</span>
On the 22nd of December, Lord Roberts had set sail from
Southampton to the Cape.  To him the British Government
had turned in its hour of need to restore the shaken prestige
of the British army and to bring the war to a successful
conclusion.  Their confidence was justified, though the conclusion
of the war was still far distant.  The horrible disaster of
Spion Kop occurred in January, but the middle of March saw
Lord Roberts in Bloemfontein.  Ladysmith and Kimberley
had been relieved, and the whole vast territory south of these
points was in uncontested occupation of the British troops.
</p>

<p>
In Mr. Labouchere's speech of March 13, on the occasion
of the second reading of the War Loan Bill, he had pleaded
eloquently for a cessation of hostilities in South Africa.
The Boers, he said, had now been driven out of British
territory, but the only terms upon which the British
Government would make peace were degrading to a brave and honest
people, namely the surrendering of their independence, and
the blotting of their nationality out of existence.  "Can
you tell me of any war," he asked, "in which the vanquished
side asked for terms and were told that the victors would grant
terms only in the capital of the defeated country, and on
condition of their surrendering their independence?  I call
this thing an iniquity, and a disgrace to this country to
propose such terms.  Perhaps the question of iniquity does not
appeal to hon. gentlemen opposite.  It is not only a crime&mdash;it
is a blunder.  I do not believe this is a way to establish peace
and harmony and good feeling in South Africa....  You are
at present appealing to the lowest passions outside of this
House.  I do not believe you will succeed in the long run; it
may be that the people will be carried away by the feeling
which at present exists among Englishmen, but they will soon
see that they have been fooled into this war by the vilest body
of financiers that ever existed in this world, and that the

There is no doubt that Mr. Labouchere was extremely
unpopular in England during 1900.  It was difficult for the
man in the street to separate his political attitude, with
regard to the war, from that of the Irish Nationalists, with
whose policy he had been so long identified, and who welcomed
the war as supplying fresh food for their campaign
of denunciation against the British Government, and who
openly expressed their exultation at the Boer successes.
Mr. Labouchere did not rejoice at the British humiliation.  The
point that he always had in view was the prevention of
more bloodshed, and the injustice of the annexation of new
territory by the force of numerical superiority.  Further, he
considered that the negotiations which took place in the
summer and autumn of 1899, before the outbreak of war,
had not been carried on with fairness towards the Boers.
After the President of the Transvaal Republic had agreed to
a seven years' Franchise Law, retrospective in its action, for
the colonists, Mr. Chamberlain took exception to a provision
of the new Bill, which required that the alien desirous of
burghership should produce a certificate of continuous
registration during the period for naturalisation.  He
suggested further that the details of the scheme should be
discussed by delegates appointed by Sir Alfred Milner and the
Transvaal Government (July 27).  The Transvaal Government,
as it had a perfect right to do, instead of immediately
accepting Mr. Chamberlain's suggestion, submitted alternative
proposals to the British Government, which gave most
liberal concessions to the Uitlanders, the details of which were
to be discussed with the British agent at Pretoria.  To these
proposals were attached certain conditions, one of which was
that "Her Majesty's Government will not insist further upon
the assertion of suzerainty, the controversy on the subject
being tacitly allowed to drop" (August 19).  Mr. Conynghame
Greene, the British agent at Pretoria, wired the Boer
proposals and conditions to Sir Alfred Milner.  Sir Alfred
Milner wired to Mr. Conynghame Greene in reply: "If
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P443"></a>443}</span>
the South African Republic should reply to the invitation
to a joint enquiry put forward by Her Majesty's Government
by formally making the proposals described in your
telegram, such a course would not be regarded by Her
Majesty's Government as a refusal of their offer, but they
would be prepared to consider the reply of the South African
Republic on its merits."
</p>

<p>
In Mr. Labouchere's opinion, it was at this point of the
negotiations that the disingenuousness of Mr. Chamberlain's
action was most apparent.  The formal reply of Her
Majesty's Government to the Boer proposals was delivered on
August 30.  It declared that the Boer proposals were
accepted, but that the British Government utterly refused
to consider the conditions attached to them.  It was obvious
now that the Boers had no other course open to them but to
fall back upon the Commission proposed by Mr. Chamberlain
on July 27, and to which their proposals and conditions
were the alternative, and, according to Sir Alfred Milner's
wire to Mr. Conynghame Greene, understood by both
Governments as such.  On September 2, therefore, they asked
for further information as to the Joint Committee which
they were now <i>par force majeure</i> and <i>faute de mieux</i>
prepared to accept.  The reply they received on September 12
was that "H.M. Government have been compelled to
regard the last proposal of the Government of the South
African Republic as unacceptable in the form in which it was
presented"; that they "cannot now consent to go back to
the proposal for which those in the note of the Government
of the Republic of August 19 are intended as a substitute";
and that, if those proposals of the Transvaal Government,
taken by themselves and without the conditions attached
by that Government, are not agreed to, "H.M. Government
must reserve to themselves the right to reconsider the
situation <i>de novo</i> and to formulate their own proposals for a final
settlement."  On September 15, the Secretary of State of
the Transvaal Republic replied that he learned with deep
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P444"></a>444}</span>
regret of the withdrawal of the invitation to a joint enquiry.
The proposal of August 19, made by him in the name of his
Government, involved the danger of affecting the independence
of the Republic, but his Government had set against
this danger the advantage of obtaining the assurances
mentioned in the conditions.  He protested against the injustice
of being asked to grant the original proposals without the
conditions annexed, and he could not understand
Mr. Chamberlain's present refusal to accept the Commission
which was his own alternative.  The reply of the Republic
consequently was that it could not grant the first half of the
August 19 offer without the second, but would accept the
Joint Commission which had been proposed by Mr. Chamberlain;
that it welcomed the introduction of a Court of
Arbitration, and was willing to help in its formation, but that
it was not clear what were the subjects mentioned as outside
the Court of Arbitration, and it deprecated the foreshadowing
of new proposals without specification.  Mr. Reitz
finally implored the acceptance of the Joint Commission,
as "if H.M.'s Government are willing and able to make this
decision it will put an end to the present state of tension, race
hatred would decrease and die out, the prosperity and welfare
of the South African Republic and of the whole of South
Africa would be developed and furthered, and fraternisation
between the different nationalities would increase."  On
September 25 Mr. Chamberlain replied that no conditions
less comprehensive than the final offer of H.M. Government
could be relied upon to effect the object for which they had
been striving.  The dispatch concluded with these words:
"H.M. Government will communicate to the High
Commissioner the result of their deliberations in a later
dispatch."  On September 30 the British agent at Pretoria
telegraphed by request of the Secretary of State of the
Republic to ask what decision had been taken by the British
Government.  Mr. Chamberlain replied on October 2
that "the dispatch of H.M. Government is being prepared
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P445"></a>445}</span>
but will not be ready for some days."  In the meantime
Parliament had been summoned to grant supplies, the
Reserves were called out, and ships were chartered to convey
all available troops to South Africa.  From September 27
to October 8 the President of the Orange Free State
telegraphed frequently to Sir Alfred Milner.  He complained
of the concentration of troops on the frontiers of his State
and of the Transvaal, again and again preferred his good
offices to avoid all possibility of war, and in almost every
telegram urged that Her Majesty's Government should at
once make known the "precise nature and scope of the
concessions or measures, the adoption whereof Her Majesty's
Government consider themselves entitled to claim, or which
they suggest as being necessary or sufficient to secure a
satisfactory and permanent solution of existing differences
between them and the South African Republic, whilst at the
same time providing a means for settling any others that may
arise in the future."  To this request Sir Alfred Milner made
no reply.[<a id="chap16fn11text"></a><a href="#chap16fn11">11</a>]  On October 9 the famous Ultimatum was presented
to the British agent at Pretoria.  Amongst other plain
statements it contained words to the effect that the Transvaal
felt obliged to regard the military force in the neighbourhood
of its frontiers as a threat against the Republic,
and that it became necessary to ask Her Majesty's Government
to give an assurance that no further troops should be
landed in South Africa, that troops on the borders of the
Republic should be withdrawn either by friendly arbitration
or some other amicable way.  In the event of a refusal the
Secretary of State of the Transvaal must regard the action
of Her Majesty's Government as a formal declaration of war.
War broke out, as has been said, on October 11.

<p>
When Lord Roberts marched triumphantly into Pretoria
on the 9th of June, some important letters were found in
the capital of the Transvaal out of which great political
interest was made against the group of Englishmen, of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P446"></a>446}</span>
whom Labouchere was one of the most important, who were
known as the "little Englanders" in contradistinction to
the ever growing numbers of "Imperialists."  These letters
were sent to Mr. Chamberlain, and a correspondence on the
subject ensued between him and Mr. Labouchere.  Mr. Labouchere
published the whole of it in <i>Truth</i>, prefacing the
letters with the following remarks:[<a id="chap16fn12text"></a><a href="#chap16fn12">12</a>]
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"The correspondence which I print below speaks for itself.
I had not supposed that I was one of the three M.P.'s whose
letters had fallen into the hands of Mr. Chamberlain, as I do
not think that I ever wrote to any one in Pretoria.  But I did,
before the war, both write and talk to Mr. Montagu White, the
Transvaal representative in London, and it would seem that he
sent some of my letters to Pretoria.  What there is requiring
explanation in either my conversations or correspondence I do
not know.  The advice which I gave to Mr. White was that his
Government should make reasonable concessions, and should
gain time, in order to tide over the false impression created by
Mr. Chamberlain's appeal to the passions which had been excited
by statements in regard to Boer rule derived from the 'kept'
Rhodesian press in South Africa and the correspondents of the
English newspapers, who were nearly all connected with that
'kept press' and with the Rhodes gang.  Had my advice been
followed, there would have been no war.  The difficulty which
stood in the way of its being adopted was that President Kruger
and other leading Boers were fully convinced that Mr. Chamberlain
had been in the counsels of the Jameson-Rhodes conspirators
of 1895, and that&mdash;no matter what concessions the Transvaal
might make&mdash;he was determined to have his revenge for President
Kruger having got the better of him on that occasion."

<p class="quote">
DEAR DR. REITZ,&mdash;I feel tired and done for to-night.  It is
past six o'clock and I still have forty miles to go before I get home.
My inclination is to wire to you, asking you to tell the British
Government to go to the devil and to do their "darnedest."  It
is perfectly sickening the way one is kept in a continual state
of suspense and nervous excitement.  Everything is as quiet as
possible on the surface, and there has been a tremendous decrease
in press cuttings which is a sure sign that matters are relapsing
into a normal condition.  But I have been able to judge of the
effect upon our friends of hints that we may not be able to accept
the proposed Commission.  Without exception, they are one and
all dead against our refusing it, and all agree that we shall have to
face a very serious crisis if we refuse the proposal, and that
without the friendly support of the majority of the newspapers which
have hitherto been on our side.  Spender of the <i>Chronicle</i>, who
has fought consistently and well for us, tells me that none of them
can understand in what way we shall be worse off for accepting
the Commission, for (if) your people disagree about the finding
of the report what can Mr. Chamberlain do further?  Even our
best friends say that by rejecting the report of the Industrial
Commission two years ago, we have allowed things to go so far
that it is unwise to talk of intermeddling in our home affairs as
a refusal to entertain what public opinion here endorses as a fair
proposal.  The essence of friendly advice is: Accept the proposal
in principle, point out how difficult it will be to arrive at a
satisfactory conclusion as to statistics, etc., and how undesirable it
would be to have a miscarriage of the Commission.  In other
words: gain as much time as you can, and give the public time
here to get out of the dangerous frame of mind which Chamberlain's
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P448"></a>448}</span>
speeches have created.  Spender is of opinion that after
two months' delay all danger will have vanished.  I cannot say
I share his optimistic views, for this sort of thing has been going
on for three years.  Labouchere said to me this morning: "Don't
for goodness sake, let Mr. Kruger make his first mistake by
refusing this; a little skilful management, and he will give Master
Joe another fall."  He further said: "You are such past masters
in the art of gaining time, here is an opportunity; you surely
haven't let your right hands lose their cunning, and you ought
to spin out the negotiations for quite two or three months."  I
must leave off now.  Please remember one thing: I do not send
you my advice.  I send you the opinions of friends and the
tendency of public feeling here.

</p>

<p class="quote">
DEAR MR. MONTAGU WHITE,&mdash;You will see the lines in
<i>Truth</i>.  I have altered one or two words to make the grammar all
right.  I do hope that President Kruger will manage to accept
in some form or another the reference (proposed conference).
Bannerman and all our Front Bench believe that it is only a way
devised by the Cabinet to let Joe climb down.  The new Franchise
Act stands.  The <i>onus probandi</i> of showing that it does not give
substantial representation to the Uitlanders and yet leave the
Boers masters is with Chamberlain.  The difference between five
and seven years is not a ground for proof.  The details for
registration do not prove it.  Let President Kruger quote our
Registration Laws, which you had better send him, and do not forget
that a lodger has to register every year; he is not automatically
on the Franchise list.  In connection with this, Milner suggested
in his dispatch six years.  He afterwards said that six was a
mistake for five.  But Chamberlain in his reply approved of six.
It is impossible to calculate the effect without knowing how many
Outlanders there are, and how long each has been in the country.
To discover the basis of inquiry would take a long time.  As the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P449"></a>449}</span>
decision would go by the majority, the question would be on the
Chairman, who would have a casting vote.  Surely it could be
arranged with Natal; the Cape and the Orange Free State, as
well as the Transvaal, should be represented, with the Chairman
an Englishman who has not yet expressed an opinion.
</p>

<p class="quote">
My own impression is that comparatively few will ever become
Boers amongst the English; they will not like to give up their
nationality.  The President has a great opportunity to give Joe
another fall.  If at the same time the Dynamite Concession is
abrogated there will be a rise in many shares, and this will be
regarded as a barometer that everything is going on well and
satisfactorily.  The great thing is to gain time.  In a few months
we shall be howling about something in another part of the
world.&mdash;Yours truly,
</p>

</p>

<p class="quote">
DEAR MR. WHITE,&mdash;It is the general opinion that Chamberlain
"climbed down."  As Bannerman put it to me: "His speech
was a little bluster of his own with the main parts arranged by his
colleagues, and they sat by like policemen to see that he read
them."  As a matter of fact he did read all the important parts.
</p>

<p class="quote">
If the President agrees to the Committee it will, under clever
tactics, take months to settle conditions, and then it will take
further months to come to a decision.  If the basis is established
that there shall be a substantial representation of the Uitlanders,
yet not such as can endanger the majority of the Boers, no harm
can well come of the Commission.  The only difficulty is that
it is a sort of recognition of our right to meddle.  But this might
be avoided in two ways: (1) By getting Schreiner into it and making
it a sort of South African affair; (2) by making a bargain and
agreeing only on the understanding that there should be arbitration
on all matters affecting the true reading of the Convention.
But if the latter is proposed then the President should put in
some proposal for the Chief Justices and one Imperial Judge or
Governor to be the tribunal.
</p>

<p class="quote">
The universal opinion is that the Cabinet has forced all this
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P450"></a>450}</span>
upon Chamberlain, and that they are determined not to have
war and to do something to let him down easily.  Salisbury's
speech was conceived on these lines, and a little vague bluster
but nothing more.  I accentuated Bannerman's declaration
about hostilities; this pledges the Liberal party against
war.&mdash;Yours truly,

SIR,&mdash;I beg to acknowledge your letter of Aug. 6, enclosing
copy of a letter of Mr. Montagu White, with copies of two letters
"purporting to have been written by me," and inquiring if I
desire to offer any explanation or observations with regard to
them.
</p>

<p class="quote">
For what I may have written or said to Mr. Montagu White
I am responsible to the House of Commons, of which I am a
member; to my constituents who have done me the honour to
send me there; and to the law.  To you I owe no sort of explanation.
I ascribe, therefore, your invitation to furnish you with
one in respect to the enclosed letters to the singular illusion that
no matter what course you may see fit to adopt, whether as a
Conservative or a Liberal Minister, all owe you a personal
explanation who take the liberty to disapprove of it, and to do
their best to prevent its bringing us into unnecessary hostilities
with some foreign power.  Whilst not recognising this pretension
on your part, I will, however, offer you some observations in regard
to these letters, as you apparently desire that I should do so.
</p>

<p class="quote">
The letters of mine enclosed were, I do not doubt, written by
me.  The only exception that I have to take to the copies is that
a few of the words in them are, I should fancy, erroneously copied,
as they do not make sense.  The advice tendered in them seems
to me to be excellent, and I know of no reason why I should not
have addressed it to Mr. White, who was then the representative
of a country with which we were at peace.  Many letters passed
before the War between that gentleman and myself.  He was
most desirous that all possibility of war should be removed, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P451"></a>451}</span>
that harmony and good feeling should be established on a firm
basis between Great Britain and the Transvaal.  This we both
thought could only be effected by a full recognition of the
Convention of 1884, as explained by Lord Derby, who signed it for
Great Britain, and by reasonable concessions on the part of the
Transvaal Government in regard to the naturalisation and
electoral franchise of the Uitlanders domiciled in the Republic.
I therefore suggested that the Transvaal Government should
grant to such domiciled aliens naturalisation and electoral
franchise of the Uitlanders on precisely the same terms as they are
granted to aliens in Great Britain.  A law thus framed would,
I thought, not be open to objection on your part, and would put
an end to all the carping criticisms raised by you in respect to
small and unimportant details in the concessions that you were
forcing on the Transvaal in regard to these matters, and which
seemed to me hardly calculated to bring about a peaceful solution
of the situation.  If I remember rightly the last letters exchanged
between Mr. White and myself were just before the close of the
normal session of Parliament last year.  Mr. White in his letter
informed me that he had received a communication from Mr. Reitz,
the Transvaal Sec. of State, in which that gentleman told
him that, although he had always been a strong advocate for all
reasonable reforms in respect of the Uitlanders, and although
he had used all his influence to promote a peaceful solution of the
pending issues between the two countries, your despatches were
so persistently insulting in their tone, and all concessions made
by his Government were so invariably met by you with fresh
demands, that even the most moderate of the Transvaal Burghers
were becoming convinced that you were determined to oblige
them either to surrender at discretion to all that you might
demand, or to defend by arms the position secured to the
Transvaal by the Convention of 1884.  He therefore suggested that
the negotiations should be taken in hand by Lord Salisbury,
in which case he was convinced that a settlement satisfactory
to both sides would be easily come to.  As I entirely agreed
with this opinion of Mr. Reitz, and believed that you were
the chief impediment to such a settlement, I replied to
Mr. White that the tenor of Mr. Reitz's communication should
be conveyed to a leading member of the Cabinet, and that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P452"></a>452}</span>
I hoped&mdash;although I did not expect&mdash;that the suggestion would
bear fruit.
</p>

<p class="quote">
As I gathered from your observations in the House of
Commons that you had not made up your mind whether you would
publish the letters of Members of Parliament to Transvaal
authorities that had fallen into your hands, I will&mdash;so far as my
letters are concerned&mdash;relieve you of further consideration by
publishing them myself, together with this correspondence.  I
have often urged that the public should have the advantage of a
full knowledge of all documents which are likely to enable them
to form a sound judgment in respect to the issues that have arisen
in South Africa.  Might I, with all respect, venture to suggest
to you that you should follow my example?  The Secretary of
State for Foreign Affairs (whoever he may be) and Her Majesty's
representatives in foreign capitals correspond not only by
despatches, but by what they are pleased to term "private letters,"
which are to all intents and purposes despatches.  I presume
that the same course is usual between Secretaries of State for
the Colonies and Her Majesty's Colonial Governors.  You have
announced that you are in favour of a "new diplomacy" in
which nothing is kept back from the public.  Would it be too
much to ask you to inaugurate the "new diplomacy" by publishing
all the so-called private letters that have been exchanged
between you and the Governors of Natal and the Cape Colony;
and all the letters and despatches exchanged between these
Governors and our military commanders in South Africa, of
which you may have copies?  Without these documents it is
impossible that either the House of Commons or the electors of
the United Kingdom can form a true conclusion in regard to the
"diplomacy" that led to the war, or be able to affix the responsibility
on the right shoulders in respect to our lack of preparation
for hostilities in South Africa and our initial reverses.  If it is
too much to hope that you will act on this suggestion, I would
venture to urge that at least you should publish the correspondence
between yourself and Mr. Hawksley in regard to your
alleged knowledge of the contemplated Rhodes-Jameson
conspiracy of 1894.  Mr. Hawksley is still, and then was, the solicitor
of the Chartered Company of South Africa, and is a close friend
and confidant of Mr. Rhodes.  When the Parliamentary Committee
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P453"></a>453}</span>
of Inquiry into all connected with the conspiracy was
sitting, Mr. Hawksley was a witness.  He alluded to this
correspondence.  But when I wished to examine him about it&mdash;which
was my right as a member of the Committee according to
Parliamentary usage&mdash;this was not permitted by the Committee.
After the Report of the Committee was published Mr. Hawksley
made public his conviction that, if this correspondence saw the
light, a guilty knowledge of the conspiracy would be brought
home to you.  When the debate on the Report took place in the
House of Commons, he placed the correspondence in the hands of
a member with instructions to read it if you made any attack
upon Mr. Rhodes.  Far, however, from doing this, you went out
of your way to assert that Mr. Rhodes had done nothing to
invalidate his rights to be considered an honourable man,
although only a few days before you had agreed to a report in
which he was branded as having been guilty of dishonourable
conduct.  Since then, again and again, you have been asked to
produce the correspondence.  But this you have persistently
refused to do, although no public interest could suffer by the
production.  Yet, if Mr. Hawksley is wrong in the inference he
deduces from the correspondence, it is obvious that its publication
would go far to allay the suspicion which led President Kruger to
doubt your desire for a peaceful solution of the strained relations
that existed between Her Majesty's Government and that of the
Transvaal Republic, and which even now militates against all
good feeling between the colonists of South Africa of British and
Dutch origin.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I trust that you will excuse my venturing to make these suggestions.
I do so because I heartily agree with you as to the desirability
of the "new diplomacy."  It is the only way in which that
popular control can be established over the Executive which is
essential in a self-governing community, if it is to escape from
falling under the domination of some purely unscrupulous
adventurer gifted with a ready tongue.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I believe with my leader, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman,
that the war might and ought to have been avoided, and I cannot
help hoping that my letters which have fallen into your hands
will show you that I laboured to the best of my ability in order
that it should be avoided.  Unfortunately these efforts were not
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P454"></a>454}</span>
successful.  The war was commenced under a lamentable ignorance
on the part of Her Majesty's Ministers of the resistance
which the two Dutch Republics would oppose to our arms.
Reverses followed owing to the meddling of civilians in military
matters.  Pretoria, Johannesburg, and Bloemfontein are in our
hands.  The Orange River Free State has been annexed.  The
Transvaal Republic has been annexed.  Under these circumstances
peace and prosperity can only be restored in South
Africa when all suspicion is removed that the Secretary of State
for the Colonies was actuated by his previous relations with the
Rhodes-Jameson conspiracy in forcing a war.  I am sure, too,
that you will agree with me that it will not be right for the electors
of the United Kingdom to be called upon to pronounce an opinion
on the policy of a war which has cost us thousands of valuable
lives and tens of millions of money, as well as on the mode in
which the war has been conducted, until all that can enable them
to arrive at a conclusion has seen the light.&mdash;I am, Sir, Your

Mr. Labouchere wisely remarked at about this period of
the South African War: "War is war.  The old Greek line
holds good that in war the great ones go mad, and the people
where it takes place weep.  This must inevitably always be
the case."  With equal force, but less elegance, he also
remarked: "I do not waste my time in answering abuse.
I am accustomed to it and I thrive under it like a field that
benefits by the manure that is carted on to it."  He must
have thriven exceedingly during the summer of 1900, for
the amount of abuse collected and thrown over him was
phenomenal.  Most of it was extracted from the most
shadowy appearances of fact possible.  The Conference, or
Commission, referred to in the Pretoria correspondence, was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P455"></a>455}</span>
understood by papers of quite high standing, such even as
the <i>Birmingham Post</i>, to be the Bloemfontein Conference,
the abortive proceedings of which had come to an end early
in June, 1899.  Nevertheless, Mr. Labouchere was accused
by the press of having, in his letters to Mr. Montagu White,
elaborated a scheme, to make the conference at Bloemfontein
not only a failure, but a deliberately planned sham.  With
regard to the cry of treason which was raised against him
indiscriminately, the dates on the letters&mdash;even had his
communications been of a treasonable nature&mdash;rendered such a
charge childish in the extreme.
</p>

<p>
As soon as Mr. Labouchere received Mr. Chamberlain's
letter with its enclosures, which followed him to the retired
Swiss Valley where he was spending his holiday, he wrote
at once to the leader of his party telling him of what had
occurred.  Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman was spending
August at Marienbad, and wrote him the following letter
in reply:

The war dragged on until the May of 1902, when the Boers
were obliged to make peace, not so much on account of the
military situation as because the burghers were weary of
fighting and wanted to lay down their arms.  And what else
could be expected of them?  Half the national army were
prisoners of war, nearly four thousand had been killed, the
rest were weakening and dwindling hourly, twenty thousand
women and children had died in the concentration camps,
thousands more were perishing on the veld.  There was no
help from Cape Colony, no help from Europe, no help from
the sympathetic minority in England itself.[<a id="chap16fn14text"></a><a href="#chap16fn14">14</a>]  The national
representatives of the South African Republic and the Orange
Free State were given three days in which to consider the
conditions of peace which were put before them by Sir
Alfred Milner, and which they were told were absolutely
final.  Their answer was given on the 31st, at five minutes
past eleven, only an hour before the expiry of the term of
grace.  The last few moments of their conference were
occupied by President Schalk Burger, who closed the
melancholy meeting with these words:
</p>

<p>
"We are standing here at the grave of the two Republics.
Much yet remains to be done, although we shall not be able
to do it in the official capacities which we have formerly
occupied.  Let us not draw our hands back from the work
which it is our duty to accomplish.  Let us ask God to
guide us, and to show us how we shall be able to keep our
nation together.  We must be ready to forgive and forget
whenever we meet our brethren.  That part of our nation
which has proved unfaithful we must not reject."
</p>

<p>
In considering the part Mr. Labouchere played in the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P457"></a>457}</span>
discussions that took place in Parliament and in the press,
during the pitiful struggle, no attitude but one of admiration
for his consistency and envy of his courage can be maintained
for a moment.  This chapter cannot be better closed than
with a repetition of his own words, expressed valiantly at
the moment when he was of all men in England perhaps, the
most unpopular: "The best settlement that can be made
now will be worse for all parties than the settlement which
could have been effected by tact and self-restraint had the
Boers never been goaded into war.  I adhere to everything
that I have ever said as to the causes that brought on this
war, with all its disastrous results.  I retract not one word
that I have published in <i>Truth</i>, or spoken in Parliament, or
written in any letter, or uttered in any shape or form about
the Chamberlain diplomacy and the Chamberlain war."[<a id="chap16fn15text"></a><a href="#chap16fn15">15</a>]

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII
<br><br>
LABOUCHERE AND SOCIALISM
</h3>

<p>
We have seen the depth and intensity of Labouchere's
political views.  Conservatism in its Tory or Whig
form he hated and relentlessly fought.  On the other hand,
it is not to be doubted that some of the modern developments
of the social side of radical policy since his retirement from
politics would be far from meeting with his approval.  The
fact is that he was as strongly anti-socialist as anti-conservative.
He believed in competition as a principle of social
existence and inequality as a natural fact, although he held
firmly that the natural inequality of men should not be
reinforced or distorted by the artificial inequality of rank.
He did not believe that the task of government could rightly
be held to imply moral responsibility towards weaklings;
such as were unable to survive by themselves should not be
assisted to do so.  This was his theory; in his personal
relations with others he often failed to practise it.  "A fair
field and no favour" was his social formula.  Government
might legitimately intervene to prevent such abuse of
opportunity as might result from the business relations of
employers and employees; but when all was done that
could be done in that way, it was a man's natural qualities
that enabled him to swim or doomed him to sink.  Any
attempt to interfere by legislation with this ultimate
differentiation of nature was in his opinion immoral and
sentimental folly.  A Cabinet had no charge of souls, it was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P459"></a>459}</span>
merely a business concern running the affairs of the nation
as cheaply and effectively as possible.
</p>

<p>
It is evident that a man holding these opinions could not
be other than unfavourable to Socialism.  The question of
Socialism, indeed, as a practical factor in politics hardly
presented itself during the most active period of his political
life, but in later days it came to the fore, and that, as might
have been expected, in his own constituency, so largely
composed of workers.  In going through Mr. Labouchere's
papers I have come across the report of a public debate which
he held with Mr. Hyndman, the well-known Socialist leader,
in the Town Hall of Northampton.  The discussion is
interesting as illustrating very clearly Mr. Labouchere's own
view of the whole problem of labour and also as showing the
definite line of cleavage between the spirit of the older
radicalism in popular estimation, at all events, and much that
is identified with the radicalism of to-day.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Labouchere had been heckled in a more or less
friendly way by some Socialist listeners at one of his meetings
and had in consequence consented to meet Mr. Hyndman
in debate.  The subject of discussion was: "The socialisation
of the means of production, distribution, and exchange
to be controlled by a Democratic State in the interest of the
entire community, and the complete emancipation of labour
from the domination of capitalism and landlordism, with
the establishment of social and economic equality between
the sexes."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Hyndman opened the discussion with a speech of
great eloquence.  He began by denouncing the terrible evils
of poverty and sickness among the working classes.  "There
are through the length and breadth of England large
proportions of the population sunk into the most terrible
misery&mdash;misery which I will defy you to find equalled in the most
savage tribes on the planet."  The growth of wealth and
poverty were admitted to be simultaneous and out of the
total wealth produced the workers only took a quarter or,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P460"></a>460}</span>
on the most favourable showing, a third.  "That means that
for every stroke of work the producer does for himself he
does three for other people.  It had been said that the
prevalent misery had been exaggerated by Socialists, but
according to the statistics of Mr. Charles Booth, who was no
Socialist, 180,000 families were living in London below the
level at which a family could subsist.  City life debilitated
country stock, and the third and fourth generations of those
who have come into our great cities become valueless even
for capitalists to make tools out of."
</p>

<p>
All this was misery due to capitalists and the system of
wagedom.  On the other hand, the economic forms of
to-day were rapidly weakening, and the probability was that
capitalism would drift much sooner than was expected into
universal bankruptcy.  "I long to see&mdash;I am not afraid
to repeat the words&mdash;a complete social revolution, which
shall transform our present society, by inevitable causes,
from senseless and miserable competition, in which men fight
and struggle with one another like pigs at a trough (the
biggest hog perhaps getting his nose in first, and, it may be,
upsetting the whole thing), into glorious and universal
co-operation where each shall work for all and all for each.
</p>

<p>
"Even now, if it were not for competition, there would
be plenty, and more than plenty, for all.  I say that the
economic forms are ready for the transformation I have
spoken of.  But first, what is our position of to-day?  The
old Malthusian delusions are gone.  Everybody can see
that where the power to produce wealth is increasing a
hundredfold, at the same time the population is increasing
but one per cent. per annum.  It is not over-population that
causes the difficulty, but the miserable system of distributing
the wealth which the population creates.  What are the
conditions to-day?  What are the powers of production
at the control of mankind?  Never in the history of man
were they near what they were to-day.  At this present
moment, Mr. Chairman, according to the evidence of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P461"></a>461}</span>
American statist, Mr. Atkinson, on the great factory farms
in the west of America, four men, working with improved
and competent machinery upon the soil, will provide enough
food for 1000; and in every other department of industry it is
true in a like, or almost in a like degree.  The power of man
to produce cloth, linen, boots, for instance, is infinitely
greater than ever before in the history of the race.  What is
more, it has trebled, quadrupled, centupled within the last
fifty or a hundred years.  What is then your difficulty at
the present moment?  Not as in old times, a difficulty to
produce enough wealth, but the fact that your very machines
which are so powerful to make wealth for all, are used against
you in order to turn thousands of you out on the streets.
It is no longer, as at was in some earlier communities, the
power to produce wealth that is lacking.  In Northampton
as in every industrial town in England, you see great mechanical
forces around you, but the workmen instead of controlling
the machines are controlled by them.  And the products?
What is our theory?  This.  All production to-day is
practically social.  Everything that is produced is produced
for exchange and in order to make profit.  Commodities
are socially produced by co-operation on the farm, in the
great workshop, in the mine.  But the moment the product
is produced it ceases to belong to those who have produced
it and goes into the hands of the employing capitalist, who
uses it in order that he may make out of it a personal gain.
Consequently, you have here a direct and distinct antagonism
between the form of production and the form of exchange.
On the one hand, you have got great mechanical forces
socially used simply for production for profit, whereas if
they were socially used and the product socially exchanged
every member of the community would benefit.  To-day
every increase in the power of machinery may result,
frequently does result, in hundreds, or thousands, or tens of
thousands of hands being thrown out unemployed on the
market.  Under the system of society we are inevitably
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P462"></a>462}</span>
coming to those very powers which will engender wealth,
happiness, and contentment for all."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Labouchere then rose and replied as follows:
</p>

<p>
"As your Chairman has already told you, this meeting
is the outcome of a remark I made the other day when I was
down here.  Some of those who entertain strong Socialist
views were asking me this or that question on the occasion
of my giving an account of my stewardship before the electors
of this town.  I pointed out that Socialism was only one of
the subjects I had got to deal with, but if they would excuse
me from going into details then I should be able to come down
and discuss with them.  I did not anticipate then that we
were to have the pleasure of Mr. Hyndman's company in
that discussion.  I thought it was to be a sort of free-and-easy
between the Socialists and myself.  But you have sent
for your big gun to demolish me.  I can only lay before you
my own views and those of the Radical Party upon social
matters, and make a few observations, showing, as I think,
that Mr. Hyndman's system, a very millennial system it is no
doubt, is neither practicable, nor, if carried out, would effect
the ends which he anticipates.  Now, Mr. Hyndman's system,
I fully admit, is for the entire regeneration&mdash;he has told
us so, I think&mdash;of the world.  It is to be carried out by a
scheme which has never yet, since the commencement of the
world, been tried.  No doubt, as Mr. Hyndman has stated,
there are evils, very great evils, and much misery in the world
under the present system.  But it is not enough to prove that
to show that any particular remedy will do away with them.
There is, no doubt, a great deal of sickness in this world.  That
we all admit.  But we should be amused if a doctor came
forward and said: 'If you try this particular pill you will find
that all sickness will be driven away from the entire world.
You are a criminal, you are mistaken, if you don't take that
pill.'  But Mr. Hyndman's plan goes much further than
the example of the pill.  You must remember that if
Mr. Hyndman's plan were not successful it would ruin this
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P463"></a>463}</span>
country and everyone in it.  Surely, then, it is our business
as practical men to look thoroughly and cautiously into this
plan before we adopt it.  Mr. Hyndman himself will admit
that it is, at least, a leap in the dark.  Mr. Hyndman has a
light in his hand, but this light is not sufficient to tell us
what would occur if we were to take this leap.  I am not
going to say just now whether it would be successful or
unsuccessful; all I say is, we ought to look at this matter in
a thorough strict and business manner, not dealing with it in
vague generalities, but looking into it in all its details,
because when it comes to a question of any business, the real
consideration in deciding whether the business is a sound one
or an unsound one is not of generalities but essentially of
details.  Now I think that Mr. Hyndman, whether his plan be
good or not, somewhat exaggerates the evils of the present
system.  Mr. Hyndman told us just now that in towns labour was
in such a condition that those who engaged in labour faded
out in three generations.  Well, I confess I was astonished at
that.  I don't suppose you are all descended from Norman
ancestors or anything of that, but I put it to you.  Many
of you can surely remember that you had great-grandfathers;
many of you had great-grandfathers who lived in Northampton.
There are many of you whose grandfathers, whose
fathers were engaged in labour.  You are engaged in labour
yourselves.  Do you feel yourselves such a puny miserable
body of men that you are going absolutely to die out?  But
I forget.  It is not that you are going to die out, you have
died out according to Mr. Hyndman.  Then what do I see
before me?  As the American says: 'Is there ghosts
here?'  Are you human beings?  There you stand; you have been
engaged in trade; you have been for many generations in
Northampton; I do think you have utterly deteriorated&mdash;that
you are absolutely worth nothing.  But statistics prove
the contrary of what Mr. Hyndman says.  If you take the
death-rate in any large town&mdash;Manchester, Birmingham, or
London, for instance&mdash;you will find that, so far from having
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P464"></a>464}</span>
gone up, it has gone down.  Notwithstanding the misery
that no doubt exists, the towns are more healthy now than
before.  Now, I do not think that Mr. Hyndman seems to
understand precisely the present system under which we live.
['How about yourself?']  My friend says 'How about
myself?'  I am going to explain the present system.  In an
argument it is always desirable to take some common ground,
and we may take this as a common ground: the end of all
government is to secure to the greatest numbers such a
condition of existence that all may obtain fair wages for a fair
day's work, and that all may be employed; and that the
government is good or bad in proportion as it approaches
to this goal.  Now, gentlemen, there are Individualists and
there are Collectivists.  Modern Radicalism, I would point
out to you, recognises this perfectly.  It recognises perfectly
that while Individualism is a necessary basis for social
organisation, yet there is a very great deal that the State can do.
Modern Radicalism is in favour of both Collectivism and
Individualism.  Now I will read to you some words I wrote
down some time ago&mdash;words that were used by a statesman
whom I do not always agree with on foreign politics, but who,
in domestic politics, is a very sensible man.  Speaking
before some association, Lord Rosebery said this:
</p>

<p>
"'Do not be frightened by words or phrases in carrying
out your designs, but accept help from whatever quarter it
comes.  The world seems to be tottering now between two
powers, neither of which I altogether follow.  The one
is Socialism, the other is Individualism.  I follow neither
the one school nor the other, but something may be borrowed
from the spirit of each to get the best qualities of
each&mdash;to borrow from Socialism its large, general
conception of municipal life, and from Individualism to take
its spirit of self-respect and self-reliance in all practical
affairs.'
</p>

<p>
"Upon that subject those are essentially my views; and
I would contend they are the views of the Radical Party
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P465"></a>465}</span>
as it at present exists.  Now I am coming to our present
system.  I am going to say something for this poor old
system.  I have often, in different parts of Northampton,
attacked the details of the system.  I am now going to say
there is something good in it.  Mr. Hyndman seems to
consider that the world is composed of a great many men who
are engaged in labour on the one side, and on the other a
great many huge capitalists who exploit those men.
Mr. Hyndman told you that the man engaged in manual labour
only receives a third of the value of his labour, and that the
other two-thirds go to those horrible capitalists.  Gentlemen,
I essentially and absolutely deny that such is the case.  But
allow me to point first to these capitalists.  Now a difference
is often made between the amount obtained by labour and
the amount obtained by those who do not engage in manual
labour.  It is exceedingly difficult to arrive at exact figures,
and for this reason, that when you take what you call the
national income of the country it is often forgotten that the
national income is very much counted twice or three times
over.  Take, in the first place, the income tax returns.  I
want to show you how money is really distributed.  There is
about £100,000,000 coming to individuals in England from
investments in foreign bonds.  Very well, and you surely
will admit that that is not derived from the labour of
Englishmen.  Then £49,000,000 is paid to officials.  It sounds an
enormous quantity, this £49,000,000 paid to officials of the
imperial and local government.  I have often thought that
a great many officials are paid a great deal too high, but we
are not entering into that this evening, and there must be
some officials; there must be some government, and payment
of the officials does not directly come from the sweat and
labour of working men.  Then there is £143,000,000 derived
from public companies.  Now these public companies are
all in shares.  These shares, too, are held by small men, not
by great men.  A vast number of men hold them.  Remember
that the whole system of limited liability companies are
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P466"></a>466}</span>
really created in order to enable small men to act together
and hold their own against the very rich men.
</p>

<p>
I now come to the real amount which is directly derived
from production and distribution, banking and such like;
which directly goes into their pockets from the labour of
working men.  For this amount you must consult what is
called Schedule D of the Income Tax.  That schedule puts
down the professions and trades.  Altogether the total is
£147,000,000 on which the tax is raised.  That is the amount
of the income.  Now, if you take the professions, law,
medicine, art, etc., as producing £67,000,000&mdash;I believe that is
considered a fair amount&mdash;£80,000,000 is left for all the
traders, all the shopkeepers, all the bankers, and all the
middlemen of the entire country.  Well now, you must remember
another thing.  You must remember that these incomes are
not eaten by the men who have them, but really go back to
labour.  ['No, no.']  Did I hear somebody say 'No'?  You
do say 'No,' do you?  Well, then, tell me what does become
of them?  Let a man spend his money in luxuries as he
likes; these have to be produced; he is a consumer; it may
be a foolish one, but his money goes back and forms a
part of the entire wage fund of the country.  When you
say they have not a right to waste and squander their
money, I think it would be better if they did not.  But just
remember how much is spent in the drink trade in this
country.  Let us look at ourselves a little, or I will trouble
you to look at yourselves a little.  £132,000,000 is the
amount, I think, that is spent every year in drink.  Of that
£80,000,000, it is estimated, is spent by the working classes.
I am not going into the question of drink, whether right or
wrong, foolish or proper; I only want to point out that every
class, to a very considerable extent, squanders a good deal of
its means.  Gentlemen, there is no more incontrovertible fact
than this&mdash;that the more capital there is in the country the
better it is for the country and the better it is for labour.  I
have already pointed out that it itself creates labour by those
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P467"></a>467}</span>
persons who have capital consuming the capital.  For
instance, this £100,000,000 which comes from foreign
investments: would it be of any use that its owners should fly
from this country with their £100,000,000 per annum?  It
is better that they should spend it here.
</p>

<p>
"There are other advantages connected with capital.
Mr. Hyndman has pointed to the evils of competitions.
Now I am going to show you that competition is really to
the advantage of the working man.  You will admit that
a certain amount of capital is necessary in order to fructify
industry.  You have to have a factory, plant, and a wage
fund.  All this requires capital.  The cheaper capital is
obtained the more there remains for wage fund.  On that
there can be no sort of difference.  ['How is it we never get
it?']  Well, you are begging the question.  I am going to
show you that you do get it.  Owing to this country having
so much increased in wealth the interest upon capital has
gone down.  There is perpetual competition going on among
capitalists themselves.  This is proved by facts.  In 1800
the interest on money was about five per cent.; at the present
moment interest is rather less than four per cent.  All
that is taken away from capital most unquestionably goes
to labour.  It cannot go anywhere else.  This is why countries
compete for capital.  Look at our colonies and foreign
nations.  Do not they all compete for capital?  Of course
they do.  There is a third reason: the greater number of
rich you have in a country, the greater the amount of wool
which you may shear for the national expenditure.  Take
Northampton.  Suppose twenty men came here, each with
£10,000 per annum.  You would say it is an uncommonly
lucky thing they have come to Northampton.  We'll levy
rates upon their houses, and they will spend money here and
benefit the town.  Suppose these men came with £100,000
and suppose they put up some hosiery factories.  Surely
you admit that that would be a great advantage to the town
of Northampton.  Evidently, the greater the amount of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P468"></a>468}</span>
capital attracted to any one particular place the greater the
advantage to that place.  The idea of driving away capital is
much like a farmer saying: I will drive away my sheep because
these sheep eat grass.  They do eat grass.  But the grass is
converted into mutton.  In the same way the money of the
capitalists is converted into a labour fund for you.  Well,
gentlemen, I say the only way for a country to be prosperous is to
encourage capital to go there, and the only way to encourage
capital to go there is to give some sort of security to capital.
</p>

<p>
"What is the difference between this country and Persia,
or any other Eastern country?  In the Eastern country a
despot is always laying hands on every atom a man can
save.  A man therefore hides away, or runs away, from the
country with his savings.  The result is that the country is
poor and the working men of that country are poor.  Now
take the cases of China and this country.  In China there
are 400,000,000 inhabitants.  No doubt the Chinese work
very hard.  There is, however, no capital there; there is no
safety for capital.  And the consequence is that the Chinese
labourers do not produce so much as the comparatively few
million workers in England.  Moreover, every fifteen Chinese
do not get the wage of one single working man in England.
The reason is that the Chinese are not industrially organised.
They have not the advantage of capital to aid them in
producing.  Each works, so to say, on his own hand, with the
result that they are far worse off than the men in the factory
which has been brought into existence by capital.
</p>

<p>
"Now, gentlemen, I will take a cotton factory, under the
present system.  It has to be built and equipped.  That
requires capital.  There is capital required for the wage fund,
that is to say, to pay wages to the men during the year,
because of course the money does not come in until the end
of the year, and then capital is required to buy the raw
material.  Mr. McCulloch says that for every adult
thousand men employed in such a factory £100,000 is required
for fixed capital, £60,000 is required for a wage fund, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P469"></a>469}</span>
£200,000 is required for the purchase of raw material.  The
total is £360,000.  Now, gentlemen, the first charge is
obviously interest on capital.  You must get the capital
in some way.  Assume that you borrow it.  You get interest
on capital.  Another charge is the raw material.  Raw
material you cannot alter because the cotton comes from
abroad.  All you can do in order to increase the amount
going to the wage fund is to reduce the amount that goes as
interest on capital, and that which is called profit to the
undertaker of the concern.  Now what is the profit in the
whole of the textile trade?  The profit and the interest on
capital do not amount to more than four per cent.  A
portion of that goes to the capitalist and the remainder for the
organising skill and intelligence of the man who brings the
whole thing together and works it.  Well, you surely will
not tell me that that is excessive.  It is rather too little.
For my part I have often wondered why in the world a man
takes the risks of trade instead of investing his money in
something that brings him in four per cent.  Mr. Hyndman
talked of the gambling interests of the capitalists.  Why, that
is all for your benefit.  Each capitalist, call him a gambler
or a vain man, thinks himself cleverer than other people and
says, I am going to make a fortune.  One does make twenty
per cent., and the other gets ruined.  But if you take the
whole body of capitalists their profits come out at four per
cent.  If it were not for the gambling chance, or the ability
shown by some undertaken in making this four per cent.,
you would not get money at so low a rate of interest as now,
nor would you get a body of skilled organisers ready to take
so little as they do take at the present moment for their
ability and work.  Now, Mr. Hyndman will, I think, admit
with me that the thousand men would not produce so much
were it not for the organising powers of some man, and also
for the capital employed.  We know they would not.  Each
man without the aid of capital would make so much a day.
With the organisation and with the capital employed in the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P470"></a>470}</span>
business he makes a great deal more, so that he really
benefits&mdash;he gets more than he would from his own particular
separate work.  He gets more that is from his collective
work by this application of capital and organisation than he
would be logically entitled to were he to work without the
aid of capital and machinery.
</p>

<p>
"Now I am going to show you by a few figures what benefit
capital has been to the working man.  Here, again, you
have a great difficulty with the figures.  They are calculated
out by various men, but I think this conclusion is generally
accepted.  In 1800 all that was earned, obtained, secured
in wages to working men was seventy millions sterling.  In
1860 this had increased to 400 millions.  In 1860 the numbers
engaged in manual labour were double those engaged in 1800,
so you must make a deduction for that.  It would then
stand thus, that whereas a man got seventy pence, shillings,
or pounds for his work in 1800, in 1860 by the co-operation
of capital he received 200.  But it is even more at the present
time, for he now receives 600 millions.  There is a dispute as
to whether it is 500 millions or 600 millions.  Mr. Giffen
says it is 600, Mr. Leone Levi says it is 531.  Mr. Hyndman
says it is 300.  Well, anyhow, that is two to one.  I stand
by Mr. Giffen and Mr. Leone Levi and take the figure as
at 531.  But here again is another way of putting it.  In the
first year of the present reign, the gross income of the country
was 515 millions.  Of this 235 millions went to labour.
Labour at the present time gets 531 millions according to
the lower estimate of Professor Leone Levi, consequently
labour now gets more than the income of the entire country
at the commencement of the present reign.
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen, there can be no more erroneous idea than to
suppose, as Mr. Hyndman apparently (as I gathered from
him) laid down, that the lot of the working man is not
bettered by machinery, or that machinery by doing part of the
work now done by working men either increases the number
of hours or reduces the wages of labour.  My contention is
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P471"></a>471}</span>
that it reduces the number of hours and increases the wage
of the individual.  Listen to this: Machinery, of course, is
revolutionising the labour market; but it is not found that
machinery, while it displaces labour, though opening up new
channels for the displaced workers, either increases the hours
of labour or decreases the remuneration.  Before the
Sweating Committee it was stated that the wages of nailmakers in
this country was 12s. a week on the average.  The American
nailer earns £6 a week; yet American nails are only half
the price of English.  The explanation is that, owing to
excellent machinery and efficient labour, maintained by high
wages and short hours, the American produces 2½ tons of
nails while the English man or woman is making two cwt.
You say 'Shame!'  I say, 'Why don't you do it?'  Why
don't you follow the example of the Americans?
</p>

<p>
"Take again the illustration of a Waterbury watch.  So
exact is the machinery which cuts the different parts of this
watch that an assistant will put one of these instruments
together in a few minutes by selecting at random a piece
from as many heaps as there are parts in the watch.  Yet
the workmen earn 45s. a week, and the watches can be sold
cheaper than those made by workmen earning 8s. or 9s. a
week in the Black Forest.  How is this?  Because by the
aid of his improved machinery the American completes 150
watches in the same time as the European is painfully
manufacturing forty.  You will say that some capitalist
wrote that; some man who was unfit to judge the matter.
I will tell you who the capitalist was.  I got it out of
Reynolds's newspaper last Saturday.  As I pointed out, in the
factory you have these diverse charges&mdash;the charge for
interest, the charge for ability in organising, and the charge
for the wage of the worker.  The business, I hold, of the
wage worker is to see that he gets a fair wage; and it is
because the only way to do this is to combine in trade unions
that I am one of the strongest advocates of trade unionism
in the whole country.  Then take distribution.  I leave
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P472"></a>472}</span>
out the carriage and sale of the various articles in the shops.
Here again competition reduces prices.  You know that as
well as I do.  You know perfectly well that you see stuck
up in some shops: 'Come and buy here; things are half a
farthing less than anywhere else.'  Shopkeepers compete
against each other.  And there you have just the same reason
as in the case of factories why men go into the business of
shopkeeping, because each man thinks he is cleverer than his
neighbour; each one believes he is going to make his fortune
and his neighbour is not.  But labour benefits by this
because the lower the price of the article the greater the demand
for it.  I say that, taking the whole shopkeepers of this
country, taking their labour, taking the amount of capital
they put into their different shops, it is impossible to say
that they get an excessive profit from their trade.
</p>

<p>
"Now, of late there has been a good deal of discussion in
regard to co-operation.  I observe that Mr. Hyndman did
not allude to co-operation.  But co-operation exists at
present, both in regard to production and in regard to
distribution.  In order to carry out co-operation on the very
largest scale it would not be necessary to alter the whole basis
of society.  Under the present despised system any working-men
may co-operate with each other, may be their own
employers, and in that way get every farthing that is derived
from their employment.  Statistics show that co-operation,
just like other things, sometimes pays and sometimes does
not pay.  In Lancashire, in Yorkshire and in the north of
England there is a great deal of co-operation both in regard
to production and in regard to distribution.  The latest
returns show that about $15,000,000 is employed in this work.
As I have said, in some cases they pay and in some cases they
do not pay.  I have observed some curious things in connection
with this.  You would say that at a co-operative store
you would get an article cheaper than at a shop, whereas, as
a matter of fact, you do not get an article cheaper.  It is a
curious thing that you don't, and the reason is this.  The
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P473"></a>473}</span>
co-operators get together in shares a certain capital which
has to pay four or five per cent.  Then each member gets
a <i>pro rata</i> return at the end of the year, a percentage upon
the amount he has paid in the store in connection with his
own particular trading.  That is perfectly fair.  Well, so
eager are they to get the return that they put up the price
of the goods against themselves.  You must remember that
while I advocate co-operation, or while I say that co-operation
needs no Socialism to enable working-men to get every
farthing from the process of production and distribution,
I do not believe that co-operation in distribution is not
without certain evils.  Why is it that shops still hold their own,
and I believe always will hold their own?  By competition
in the first place prices in the shops are reduced to as little
as or less than the prices in the stores.  Again, if a man wants
a red herring he don't walk to the middle of the town, near
where the stores have to be, but prefers going to a
neighbouring shop and buying it there.  Moreover, we know that
a great many men have spent their wages before the end of
the week, and they want a little credit.  You may depend,
upon taking all things into consideration, that no very great
benefit is to be got out of co-operative distribution.  I
merely went into this question of co-operation, not to
discuss so much the advantages or disadvantages of co-operation,
as to point out to you that co-operation can exist, may
exist, and does exist among working men, whenever they
like it, under the present system.
</p>

<p>
"Now I come to Mr. Hyndman's plan.  I have said a few
words in favour of the present system.  I have tried to
explain what that present system is, and how, as a matter
of fact, labour does benefit by the existence of capital and
capitalist.  Mr. Hyndman's plan, I take it, is based upon
the notion that labour does not get its full share; that it
only gets one-third.  ['It ought to get the lot.']  Very
well, I have often in the course of my life thought I ought to
get the lot, but I have never got it, I can tell you.  Mr. Hyndman's
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P474"></a>474}</span>
idea is that if the State took upon itself the
functions performed by private capitalists everybody would
be fully employed and properly paid.  Could this desirable
result be brought about?  That is the real thing.  If,
at once, under Mr. Hyndman's guidance we could enter upon
the millennium we should all be for entering.  But the
question is whether we <i>should</i> enter it by this gate or whether
we should get somewhere else.
</p>

<p>
"I have got here the programme of the Social-Democratic
Federation.  I have extracted it from Justice.  It is all
right.  Mr. Hyndman pointed out that a great many things
in the programme were merely doctrines which had been
put forward by the Socialists, and had now been adopted by
the Radicals.  I should say that there was a great deal in it
that was put forward by the Radicals and had always been
advocated by the Radicals; and we are exceedingly glad that
the Socialists agree with us so far.  Now I like this
programme.  What has been my trouble in talking with some
Socialists is that they never have the courage of their own
opinions.  What are you hissing for?  I am going to praise
you.  As members of the Social-Democratic Federation
you are surely not going to take under your wing every
Socialist in the world.  I have often had discussions with
Socialists, and I have found that they leave out certain
portions of their programme.  I have said to them: That is a
necessary plank in your programme; knock out any of
these stones and you knock down the arch.  You have done
nothing of the kind.  You have fairly and squarely put this
as the Social Revolution in all its details.  You see I am not
complaining of you, so don't cry out again before you are
hurt.  Now, Number 7 says: 'The means of production,
distribution, and exchange to be declared as collective or
common property.'  Now, what does this mean?  That
all manufacturing, all shopkeeping, all shipping, all the
agricultural industry, and all banking ought to be done by
the State&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P475"></a>475}</span>
</p>

<p>
<i>Mr. Hyndman</i>: "Community."
</p>

<p>
<i>Mr. Labouchere</i>: "Or community.  Every man, as I
understand it, is to do his bit of work, every man is to have
his share of the profit of the business.  Have you ever
thought what amount of capital this would require?  The
building of factories would require 1000 million pounds
for ten million workers.  The wage fund would be 600
millions; the raw material would be 200 millions; the
shipping, say about 500 millions.  I am trying to underestimate
the amount.  As to the shops, I suppose, if you took all
there are in the whole country, they would cost about 100
millions.  Then the agricultural buildings and machinery,
excluding the land itself, would be, say, 500 millions.  This
would be very much under a proper estimate, but still the
whole amount runs up to something like 3000 millions.  Are
all the factories to be seized?  My friend says 'Yes.'  That
will knock off 1000 millions at once.  Are all the shops to be
seized?  ['Yes, yes.']  This will knock off 100 millions
for the shops.  Still, if you do this, you won't certainly
have done.  Obviously you have to buy the raw material,
you have to have a wage fund, and a good deal to keep the
machinery in order even when you have laid hands on it in
the expeditious way your friend proposes.  That would be
2000 millions.  How are you going to get it?  You would
borrow it.  <i>Would</i> you borrow it?  Let us suppose you
borrow it.  To borrow it you have to get somebody to lend
it to you.  I have known a great many persons ready to
borrow more than people are ready to lend.  Another item,
which I am bound to say is not in the Radical programme of
the Social-Democratic Federation, is the repudiation of the
National Debt.  Now, sure, if you repudiate the National
Debt you would find a difficulty in getting anybody to
lend you the money you want.  Where are you going to
get it?  Are you going to levy it upon property?  What
property are you going to levy it upon?  We'll allow that the
land and factories are to be seized.  If they are not to be
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P476"></a>476}</span>
seized they are to be ruined; they are to be left high and dry.
No individual man is to work in them.  You would have
a certain amount of portable property like the money that
comes in from foreign investments, but its owners would not
wait to have it taken.  They would immediately clear out
of the country."
</p>

<p>
<i>Mr. Hyndman</i>: "Hear, hear."
</p>

<p>
<i>Mr. Labouchere</i>: "I am going from surprise to surprise.
I really do believe that Mr. Hyndman wishes that the men
with the 100 millions should clear out of the country.
These 100 millions are derived from investments made
abroad.  The investments are already made, and the
money may be paid here or abroad just as its owners please.
Therefore you would absolutely have no control over it.
Its owners could walk off to America or France to-morrow,
or to one of our colonies, where they would be welcomed with
pleasure and where they would be able to live with their
100 millions and spend it just as they liked.  The only
difference would be that they would not be consumers
here, they would not compete with their capital to reduce
the interest on the capital necessary to run the whole business
of the country.  I am very curious to know, I cannot quite
make out, whether a man may save or not.  It is not clear.
I see one of the articles is, 'the production and distribution
of wealth is to be regulated by society.'  That leads me to
suppose he may not save.  I should say myself that if you
are going to carry out this millennium you could only do it
by preventing any sort of saving: because if savings take
place you will have some men rich and some poor, evidently.
But how about the professions?  What are they to be done
with?  Are professional men not to be allowed to make any
savings?  I see all justice is to be free.  Well, that would
create a good deal of litigation; but I personally suffer a
good deal from justice, so that I don't know that I should
particularly object to that item.  You would have, I
presume, these professions!  You would have doctors and men
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P477"></a>477}</span>
engaged in art and so forth?  They would be able to sell
their productions abroad, their skill abroad.  Consequently
how would you regulate their fortunes?  How are you going
to regulate the distribution of wealth in regard to these men?
I say the thing is absolutely and utterly impracticable.
You could not.  Yet, gentlemen, it seems there is some idea
of saving, for I see this in another article: 'The extension of
the Post Office Savings Bank which will absorb all private
institutions that draw profit from money or credit!'  Well,
but who would put into the Post Office?  The Post Office,
if they did put it in, would have to incur all the risks of the
great business.  But I told you that the National Debt was
to be repudiated.  What is the fact?  That the Post Office
Savings Bank has invested £5,599,000 of public savings, of
labour mainly, in consols.  If, consequently, you were to
do away with the National Debt one of the things you would
do would be to repudiate five millions sterling saved by
labour.  Now, I think it was some gentleman who was
discussing the matter with me in the <i>Reporter</i> who said that you
might save, but no man would be allowed to employ any
savings by making another man work for him.  Allow me to
point out to you that indirectly one man must work for
another if he does not work for himself.  Is he going, like that
wicked man in the Bible, to hide his talent in a napkin?
Not a bit.  I suppose he will make a little interest on it.
He won't work for the interest himself, so somebody else
will.  If you are going to try to distribute wealth you will
have continual disputes, for I deny that, so long as human
nature is what it is, so long as a man wants to lay by
something for his children, you will be able to prevent savings.
The only thing you would be able to do would be to frighten
savings away from this country, and cause them to be taken
to some other country, which would compete against you.
</p>

<p>
"Let us suppose now that this initial difficulty of
obtaining the money is got over.  Then there comes the
organisation.  Well, who would organise?  Who would be
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P478"></a>478}</span>
superintendents, and who would be workers?  Who would
engage in the complicated business of exchange with foreign
countries?  Remember, all skilled talent would disappear.
You say 'Ha, ha!'  Do you really think that a man who
perhaps is a skilled organiser of labour, who could earn a
thousand or two thousand a year abroad or in the colonies,
would stay here and receive an exceedingly small sum, simply
because he was an Englishman?  Of course he would go
away.  I say you would deprive the country of its most
intelligent organisers.
</p>

<p>
"There is another difficulty.  Who would settle the
employment to be secured for each person?  Here is a
shepherd.  He would say: 'I want to be a shoemaker.'  'My
good friend,' they would say, 'we don't want you; go
and be a shepherd.'  They'd say to me: 'We've got quite
enough newspapers without yours.  We want a good
chimney sweep.  Be that.  Go to Newcastle.'  They'd say to
our friend, Mr. Hyndman: 'We'll find employment for you
in hay-making in Somersetshire.'  Mr. Hyndman may say
he likes that paternal arrangement; he likes hay-making.
I'll tell you one thing: I wouldn't go and sweep chimneys
in Newcastle.  But you say that the State carries on the Post
Office, the Army, and the Navy, among other things; and
I say it carries them on exceedingly badly too.  You will
find, taking ship for ship, that ships can be built in a private
yard much cheaper than in a public yard.  As for the Post
Office, I agree with Mr. Hyndman in saying I do not know
any public Department so badly managed as the Post Office.
There is an enormous deal of sweating; the big men get too
big salaries, and the little men do not get enough.  If the
Army, Navy, and Post Office be an exemplication of what
would be done under the paternal arrangement, Heaven
help us!
</p>

<p>
"But, gentlemen, what really surpasses my understanding
is this, how in the world, if Mr. Hyndman's system were
adopted, any regular work, or shorter hours, or better pay,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P479"></a>479}</span>
or employment of all would be more easily obtained than
under the present system.  I say your capital, if you did get
it, would be at a higher cost.  I say that profit, if you take
profit, is almost reduced by competition to a minimum.
You would not make one shilling by the transaction.  Supply,
surely, would depend upon demand.  You could not alter
that.  Take the foreign trade.  You would not increase your
foreign trade, under this system.  You would still have to
compete with foreign countries in China and elsewhere.
Foreign consumers would take goods from those from whom
they could buy them cheapest.  The Socialists have
perceived this, and they have invented the idea of establishing
on the land an enormous number of labourers, who are to act
as consumers, and consequently take all the home surplus
products.  And I see here it is proposed that the Municipal
or State army of labourers should be organised as on the great
farms in America.  Mr. Hyndman alluded to what they did
on these bonanza farms.  They send men down to them twice
a year, once to sow and once to reap.  You might find if you
had the proposed armies that the product might be increased,
but the number of persons employed on the land, that is to
say, the consumers on the land, would be reduced.  That is
why I have been in favour of small holdings.
</p>

<p>
"As to the numbers of the agricultural labourers, those
labourers won us the election last time, remember.  What
are you hissing at?  Did you want the Conservatives to win?
You must take people as they are.  These agricultural
labourers may be wrong, but their strongest desire is to
become possessors of small holdings.  That has been the
aim and object of the Parish Councils Bill, which will slowly
and quietly nationalise the land by throwing the property,
little by little, and very quickly I think, into the hands of the
Parish Councils, who will let it to the villagers.  You will
then get a large number of agriculturalists on the land, far
greater than now, consuming your products.  At the same
time you would avoid their coming into the towns and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P480"></a>480}</span>
competing with you for labour.  The subject is a very lengthy
one.  As I said, you have to go into the question in all its
absolute details.  I will only tell you one other reason why
I object to this system of making us all children in the hands
of the State.  I say it would be the greatest danger to our
liberties.  Why is the Anglo-Saxon race the master race in
the world?  Why has the Anglo-Saxon race maintained its
liberties?  It is because of that individualism, that
self-reliance, which exists in this country.  I would trust no body
of men, not Mr. Hyndman and the leaders of the Social-Democratic
Federation&mdash;though I make no implication
against them&mdash;nor even a body of angels, with the power of
destroying and ruining, at one fell blow, the entire nation.
This unquestionably would be the case, and who would be
able to resist it?  You would have some strong and powerful
man coming forward, supported by all the discontented, all
the men who were not prepared to accept this wondrous
dispensation, this dead level of equality.  I say you would
have such a man; I say the risk is too great.  Mr. Hyndman
has alluded to France.  What did one great Frenchman,
M. Guizot, say?   He said: 'The evil of France is that a
Frenchman must either be administered or an
administrator.'  What is the consequence of that feeling?  They
have no self-reliance.  Every now and then they have a
Republic, and then comes one like Napoleon, who overturns
their Republic and seizes upon the whole thing.
</p>

<p>
"I have almost finished now.  I infinitely prefer listening
to Mr. Hyndman to speaking myself, but I had to make some
defence of the cause by which I stand.  I do say that the
Radical Party as at present constituted, the modern Radical
Party, has adopted every reasonable idea of Socialism.  And
the future of this country depends upon Socialism being
recognised within proper limits&mdash;Collectivism I would prefer
to call it&mdash;individualism being recognised, trade unionism
being recognised, co-operation being recognised.  We must
all give up our little separate fads and all work together in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P481"></a>481}</span>
the cause of Democracy, the rule, the absolute rule, of the
people, ruling for the benefit of the people."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Hyndman said in reply:
</p>

<p>
"There are just one or two points I should like to deal
with in reply to Mr. Labouchere.  To begin with I have
listened with the greatest surprise to-night to his constant
reference to the wage fund.  Without any disrespect to him
I say that, as a matter of fact, that figment has been
abandoned by every political economist of any note for the last
thirty years.  It was abandoned by Mr. John Stuart Mill,
in deference to the criticism of Long and Cairnes
twenty-five years ago.  The bottom was knocked out of it by
Marx forty years ago.  What is the wage fund, my friends?
The wage fund is provided by the labourer himself, who,
mark you, advances his labour to the capitalist before he
gets a farthing of wages.  There is not a man in this hall,
however big an Individualist or Radical he may be, not a
single working man here who goes to work from week end to
week end that does not advance a week's labour to the
capitalist before he gets a sixpence in return.  The fact of
the matter is that the capitalist has got in his possession the
value, and more than the value, far more than the value paid
as wages before he pays a sixpence of those wages.  He can
go to his banker with the product he has got out of the
labourer and get an advance before he pays those wages.
Practically in getting the advance he realises the product of
his employees' labour.  The fallacy of the wage fund theory
is recognised by every economist, and I defy Mr. Labouchere
to prove I am wrong.  I will defy Mr. Labouchere to name
an economist who upholds it."
</p>

<p>
At this point of Mr. Hyndman's speech Mr. Labouchere
rose and said:
</p>

<p>
"I deny that there is one single economist of repute who
questions the effect of what I said about the wage fund.  The
employer has either to provide himself with a wage fund, and
then he is entitled to interest on his money, or he has to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P482"></a>482}</span>
borrow it from someone else, and then he has to pay interest.
The working-man, it is perfectly true, gives him credit for a
week&mdash;not always, but I am taking Mr. Hyndman's
statement&mdash;but the employer does not, I say&mdash;take the cotton
industry&mdash;the employer does not get back his money till the
end of the year.  Consequently, whereas the working man
gives credit for a week, the employer has to give him credit
for fifty-one weeks.  ['No, no.']  I say yes, there is no
question about it.  All that I want to point out is that you
have to pay interest on this wage fund.  Mr. Hyndman
admits it, because he says, what does he do?  He goes and
obtains it from his banker.  Does his banker give it to
him?"
</p>

<p>
To which Mr. Hyndman retorted, not ineffectually:
</p>

<p>
"I say that the security has been provided by the working
man before the capitalist is able to raise a sixpence on it,
and that all he does is to divide up the surplus value he has
got from the worker with the banker who has made the
advance.  There is no such thing as a wage fund, except that
provided by the worker himself.  And it is exactly the same
with the capital.  Friends and fellow-citizens, where does
this capital come from?  From the labourers themselves.
Where can the capital come from if not from the labour of
the workers?  Did not the workers build every factory in
this country, from its base to its topmost storey?  Did
they not put down every sleeper on the railways, and lay
down every mile of line?  I say, therefore, that this idea of
the wage fund, which has been repudiated by John Stuart
Mill, by Cairnes, by Mr. Alfred Marshall, by every economist
of note, does not exist in economy, but is a figment of
the imagination.  Now, friends, as to this question of
families fading out.  Mr. Labouchere says that the death-rate
has lowered.  That is perfectly true.  On the average
the death-rate <i>has</i> lowered.  But mark this.  It has lowered
principally in the well-to-do districts.  The death-rate in
St. George's, Hanover Square, is 11 per 1000; in several
districts of Lambeth it is 66."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P483"></a>483}</span>
</p>

<p>
Mr. Labouchere, evidently astonished, turned to the
Chairman and said, "Is that a fact?"  Some one in the
audience shouted "Proof!"
</p>

<p>
"Proof you must look up in the statistics; I can't bring
a library here with me.  I say, friends, in addition to that,
that vitality is on a lower plane.  For this, again, I give as
my authority passages quoted in Alfred Marshall's <i>Principles
of Economics</i>, where you will find the opinions of doctors.
I also refer you to reports of certifying surgeons for the
factories for the year 1875 and later dates.  I say that when
I speak of families fading out, I mean that the physical and
mental vigour and initiative of those families are crushed
down in our great cities.  I have never heard it disputed
before; I don't think I shall hear it disputed again.  If you
ask any of the great contractors as to his supply of powerful
navvies, he will tell you he cannot get them out of the towns.
If you ask any of the recruiting officers he will tell you the
lads from the cities are physically useless.  You will find
the standard of height for recruits has decreased five inches
during the present reign, and the chest measurement in
proportion.  Consequently there is, I say, in our great cities,
which form the bulk of the population, a constant physical
deterioration going on, which will end in the fading-out of
the people unless we replace this system of robbery and
rascality and oppression that is going on at present by a
better.  I cannot stop any length of time to dispute about
the way in which the wealth that is taken from the workers
is divided up.  It matters not to me whether it is the Royal
Family, or the professional men, or the servants who divide
it, or in what proportion they divide it, after it has been
taken from the worker.  That makes, I say, no difference
whatsoever.  The workers never see it again.  Four per
cent. also on £100,000,000 is forty per cent. on £10,000,000.
How is the amount of capital reckoned?  Mr. Labouchere
knows perfectly well that a coal mine or factory which has
cost but £40,000 will frequently be capitalised at £200,000.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P484"></a>484}</span>
That is the way they put it in the Blue Books.  I can give an
example of a mill in Rochdale where the freehold belongs to
the man who owns that mill, when and where every single
charge is met in a separate category, and then, after all these
are divided, the interest on the capital is reckoned over again
on the whole capitalised value.  I say that four per
cent. does not represent the profits on cotton, even in these
comparatively bad days for the cotton industry.  But the mere
fact that the profit is going down means that competition is
cutting its own throat, that we are no longer masters of the
markets of the world.  And what does the capitalist do when
his profits go down?  He tries to make another turn of the
screw on his labourers&mdash;and the result was the great cotton
strike which occurred a short time ago, when, for sixteen
weeks on end, the poor unfortunate spinners and weavers
stood out because they would not have that amount which
the capitalist was losing in the competitive market sweated
out of their very bone and blood.  So much for your four
per cent. or your forty per cent.  It is wrung out of the
workers, it can come from nobody else.  As to the organiser,
what did the Roman slave-owner give to his villeins, who
stood in the same relation to the working slaves as the
capitalist organiser to the labouring classes to-day?  He
paid him lower remuneration because his labours were less
exhausting.  That is a positive fact.  I say that if you want
organisers who to-day are appointed by the capitalist, let
them be appointed by the workers, who can pay them far
better than the capitalists, because you will have all the
capitalists' profits and all the amounts the capitalists sweat
out of their employees' labour as well to pay with.  ['Don't
capitalists start as working men?']  Yes, and the more they
grab, the bigger they get.  As to the amount received by
the working men as wages, Mr. Leone Levi was one of the
most unscrupulous and lying champions of the capitalist
class who ever wrote.  He represented that the average
wages of working men and women throughout England
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P485"></a>485}</span>
were 32s. a week.  That is a positive fact; it is on record in
his own books.  Thirty-two shillings a week!  I say that
is a deliberate lie.  And that is how he made out his
amount of 531 millions.  As a matter of fact, Mr. Giffen
and Mr. Mulhall both included in the wages of the working
classes all those paid to domestic servants, the soldiers and
sailors, all that is paid to your noble friends the police.  I
say that, as a matter of fact, those are not producers in the
common sense of the word.  They are simply encumbrances
upon the industrial community.  I say, further, that out of
the amount paid in wages to the working classes, which I
reckon at £300,000,000 to £350,000,000, not a sixpence more,
one-fifth or one-fourth has to be paid as rent for the miserable
dwellings the workers occupy.  That is, I say, the position of
the labouring portion of the community at the present time.
I am told that shopkeepers are a useful class.  Well, surely
there are too many of them.  You will find in one street half
a dozen people vending the same wares.  The organisation
of any decent system of distribution would not allow such
a state of things to continue, but would turn the unnecessary
distributors into producers, and thus lighten the weight of
producing on the others.  Mr. Labouchere does not seem
to understand that what we want is not money.  You cannot
eat it; you cannot be clothed with it.  What you want is
good hats, good homes, and good beefsteaks&mdash;enjoyment,
contentment in life, comfort, and beyond all these, public
amusements of every kind.  I say that these have nothing
whatsoever to do with money.  If you want to save, you
don't want to save money; you want to save those things
which are necessary to the support and continuance of life.
Mr. Labouchere seems to think that communism is unknown
on this planet.  I say that human beings far lower in the
range of civilisation than we, with comparatively small and
puny means of production, live far more happily, in far
better conditions of life, than enormous proportions of our
great city population.  Where?  I will tell you.  I say I
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P486"></a>486}</span>
have lived among communal tribes where, as a matter of
fact, the conditions are as I have told you.  The inhabitants
of Polynesia, the Pueblas of New Mexico, and the people of
other places which I have not seen, live better, considerably
better, with all their small means of production, than the
proletariat of our great cities, and they produce, regard
being had to the productive powers at their command, articles
of clothing and domestic use as remarkable in their way as
the finest products of civilisation.  More than that, all the
great bed-rock inventions of humanity, the wheel, the
potter's wheel, the smelting of metals, the canoe, the rudder,
the sail, every one of these and many more, the stencil plate
and weaving, to wit, were invented under communism and
no human being knows who invented them.  That is a
sufficient answer to the supposition that under a Socialist
state of society there would be no progress in the invention.
But I am asked what the capitalists will do when the
transformation to a co-operative commonwealth is made.  They
will go away with their capital.  What is capital?  Capital
is the means and instruments of production used by a class
to make profit out of labour.  Can the capitalist roll up the
railways and take them away in his portmanteau?  Will he
walk away with the factories in his waistcoat pocket?
Mr. Labouchere himself sees the futility of some of this.  He
advocates the nationalisation of the railways because he
says that they will be better administered under the State
than to-day."
</p>

<p>
<i>Mr. Labouchere</i>: "No, no."
</p>

<p>
<i>Mr. Hyndman</i>: "Why then do you want to nationalise them?"
</p>

<p>
<i>Mr. Labouchere</i>: "I very much doubt whether they would
be better managed in the sense that they would produce
more money than now.  I hold that the roads of a country
ought to belong essentially to the State.  It is better for the
general benefit that they should be held collectively.  I do
object to their giving preferential rates to foreigners and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P487"></a>487}</span>
charging excessive amounts to persons sending goods a
short distance in England.  That is the reason why I
think the railways would be better in the hands of the
State."
</p>

<p>
<i>Mr. Hyndman</i>: "As a matter of fact, preferential rates
can be stopped without the nationalisation of the railways.
Mr. Labouchere can bring in a Bill when Parliament meets
to prevent them.  Why, then, is he so Utopian as to demand
the nationalisation of the railways?  I want, however, to
raise the discussion out of the minor points, and I say this,
that Socialism does not mean organisation by the State
under the control of Mr. Hyndman, or any one else, but the
entire organisation of industry, on the highest plane of
co-operation for the benefit of all.  In that co-operative
commonwealth competition for profit will be unknown.
Mr. Labouchere has drawn a tremendous picture of what it will
cost to effect the change.  What does the social system cost
you as it is going on to-day?  Competition carried to its
logical issue must engender monopolies.  These monopolies
have been given by the capitalist class to themselves in their
capitalist House of Commons.  That assembly must be
re-constituted and turned to Social-Democratic purposes.
But then you will lose all those clever men who will not join
with you!  Where will they go?  We are stronger in France
than in England, and stronger in Germany than in France.
Will they go to China?  That seems to me the last refuge
of the wandering individualist, the last place on the planet
where the individualist will be able to go.  Socialism is
gaining ground in every country in the world, and mark this,
where the people are best educated, there we are most
powerful.  Germany is the best educated country, and
Socialism is stronger there than in any other nation.
Whatever city in England has a body of educated workers, there
we make way quickly.  Mr. Labouchere seems to think that
no one will serve his fellowmen unless he is able to grab from
them.  His idea of humanity seems to me&mdash;I wish to say
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P488"></a>488}</span>
nothing that is in the least offensive, and I will withdraw it
at once if it is considered so."
</p>

<p>
For about a minute there was disorder so great that
Mr. Hyndman was unable to proceed.  The Chairman rose and
appealed for quietness during the two or three minutes that
remained to Mr. Hyndman.  Silence having been restored,
Mr. Hyndman said:
</p>

<p>
"I say, friends, that the representation that the men of
intelligence, of genius, of capacity, and the like would leave
us and go to other places means that they are not animated
by the idea of serving their species, but simply of making
their own fortunes.  I say that mankind, as a whole, has
higher ideals than that.  I say that all the great work done
on this planet, all the great books that have ever been
written, all the great inventions that have ever been made,
have not been made for money, but for something higher
than that.  I say further, that when a man has been paid
all he requires to sustain a happy, contented, and wholesome
life, when he has around him a people living happily with
him, co-operating with him, when he sees that every effort
he makes tends to the advantage of the whole community
and to the drawback and domination of none, I say that
then, animated with a lofty public spirit, he will place
his whole power, his whole intelligence, his very faults, and
his life at the disposal of the community he benefits by his
existence."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Hyndman went on to point out that many of the
reforms adopted by the Radicals were in reality due to
Socialist inspiration.  He instanced the eight hours day and
the nationalisation of railways, which Mr. Labouchere had
advocated, and concluded what must have been a stirring
and able speech as follows:
</p>

<p>
"Now I repeat, friends and fellow-citizens, that we are
arguing for what is inevitable, that at the present moment
the capitalist system, like the feudal system before it, and
chattel slavery before that, heads back progress.  I say
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P489"></a>489}</span>
that now, in many directions the force of electricity, and
various great mechanical and chemical inventions, which
might tend to the benefit of the race are being headed back
by low wages and vested private interests.  I don't think
anybody can deny that.  It must be admitted also that
universal commercial crises have occurred time after time
in this century, each one worse than the one before it.  Since
the Baring crisis of 1890 there have been great financial
difficulties, and thousands and tens of thousands of people
have been thrown out of work.  Why?  Not because there
is not plenty of wealth to be produced, but because, as a
matter of fact, the power to produce it is taken from the
producers altogether.  I say that, whether we like it or not,
a system of Socialism is being built up out of the facts of
to-day.  From the misery we see around us there is necessarily
arising a glorious future, the golden age which all the
greatest of the sons of men from Plato and Moore onward
have desired and foreseen, an age in which wage-slavery and
competition having ceased, men will co-operate for the
greater advantage and enjoyment of all.  Friends, that
which the great thinkers of old saw through a glass darkly
we see face to face.  We are the inheritors of the martyrdom
of men to the forms of production and distribution throughout
the ages.  I ask you to-night not to treat this question
as being brought down to you from on high, but as growing
up under your feet below.  Consider it earnestly for the
sake of the men, women, and children who are being crushed
down in our cities, and whose lives may be rendered worthy
and happy.  Let us uplift ourselves at once from the
question of twopenny and twopenny-halfpenny profit into a
higher, nobler, and more glorious sphere."
</p>

<p>
Mr. J. G. Smith, on behalf of the Socialists, wound up
the proceedings by proposing a vote of thanks to both
speakers.  He expressed his appreciation of the "sincerity
and honesty" with which Mr. Labouchere had met Mr. Hyndman.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P490"></a>490}</span>
</p>

<p>
Opinions will probably differ as to who really got the
better of this encounter, nor shall I be rash enough to
award the palm.  At least Mr. Labouchere's speech shows
the sort of way in which he approached the question.  It
shows his dislike of theory, his determination to stick to the
concrete, and his distaste for rhetoric.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII
<br><br>
MR. LABOUCHERE AS A JOURNALIST
</h3>

<p class="t3">
BY MR. R. BENNETT, EDITOR OF "TRUTH"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Labouchere went into newspaper work with all the
best qualifications that a journalist can have, and
with many that no other journalist has ever had a chance of
possessing.  He had an inborn gift for writing, using his
pen by sheer force of natural impulse.  He took a lively and
unfailing interest in all the doings, sayings, and thoughts of
his fellow creatures, while looking at all human affairs with
critical but dispassionate detachment.  His reflections, if
not very profound, were always acute, novel, and humorous;
and he had a method of expression, whether in speech
or writing, peculiarly his own&mdash;pithy, witty, and
unconventional.  He was a great reader; he was at home in French,
German, and Italian; he had acquired a smattering of the
classics at Eton and Cambridge; and he had a retentive
memory.  When he first took up journalism he was nearly
forty, and he had had an unrivalled experience of all phases
of life, extending from Jerusalem to Mexico.  Among other
things, he had spent ten years as an attaché in six or eight
different capitals; he had gambled in nearly every casino
in Europe; he had travelled with a circus in America; he
had run a theatre in London; he had sat in the House of
Commons; he had dabbled in finance in the city.  Add to
all this that he had a considerable aptitude for business, as
for most other things; lastly that he was never under any
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P492"></a>492}</span>
obligation to write a line except to please himself; and it is
not surprising that he made a distinguished mark in the world
of journalism.  It is perhaps not too much to say that the
best work of his life was done as a journalist.
</p>

<p>
Yet he seems to have tumbled into this work quite
accidentally, and in the most unusual fashion.  He began
as a newspaper proprietor; he subsequently became an
editor; and he ended as a casual unpaid contributor.  This
strange inversion of the normal career of a successful journalist
is in keeping with everything else in his life and character.
The story of his proprietorship of the <i>Daily News</i> and of his
association with Edmund Yates on the <i>World</i> has been told
elsewhere in this book.  His work on those papers, extending
over seven years, had given Mr. Labouchere a useful and
varied experience of very different classes of journalism
when he decided, in 1876, to start a journal of his own.
There had been no quarrel of any kind between him and
Yates, and it was not in any spirit of antagonism to the
proprietor of the <i>World</i> that he decided to make his own
paper one of the same type.  At that date there was rather
a reaction against the solidity and stolidity of the older
journalism, and out of it had sprung a class of journals
animated by a lighter spirit, and handling both men and
things in a free and easy style.  <i>Vanity Fair</i> and the <i>World</i>
had been very successful in this line, and their spirit appealed
to Mr. Labouchere, who detested pretentiousness in every
shape, and to the end of his days never ceased to regard as a
ridiculous object the journalist who takes himself seriously.
"What is <i>Truth</i>?" asked some successor of jesting Pilate,
who had heard of the title proposed for the new paper.
"Another and a better <i>World</i>," replied Labouchere; and
the quip no doubt expressed correctly what he had in his
mind.  The spirit in which he proposed to endow London
with a new journal is perhaps even better shown in the title
originally projected for this organ, which was, not "Truth,"
but "The Lyre."  It was in deference to the opinion of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P493"></a>493}</span>
Horace Voules that Mr. Labouchere consented to abandon
"The Lyre" in favour of "Truth."  Voules's business
instinct, which was highly developed, warned him that it is
better to assume a virtue if you have it not.  No doubt he
was right.  Nobody, so far as I know, has yet had the
courage to start a paper called "The Lyre," but Mr. Labouchere
would have done it had he been left to himself.
</p>

<p>
The mention of Voules reminds one that Mr. Labouchere's
first step when he had decided upon his new venture
was to find a competent practical journalist to undertake the
"donkey work."  In a lucky moment he fell upon Horace
St. George Voules, who eventually became his <i>alter ego</i> in
<i>Truth</i> office.  Horace Voules himself was a man of very
remarkable personality and abilities.  He was the son of a
well-known solicitor at Windsor, who, by a strange freak of
fortune, was the local Tory election agent, and as such had
been instrumental in unseating Mr. Labouchere when he
was returned for that borough.  While still only a boy Voules
had formed an ambition to become a journalist, and, by way
of beginning at the beginning, had entered the great printing
and publishing house of Cassell, Fetter, and Galpin as a
printer's apprentice.  He made his way upward with
extraordinary ability, and the partners formed such a high opinion
of him that when, in 1868, they started the <i>Echo</i>&mdash;the first
London halfpenny paper&mdash;they put Voules in as business
manager.  He was then only four-and-twenty.  He continued
to manage the <i>Echo</i> with remarkable success till the
summer of 1876, when it was acquired by the late Mr. Passmore
Edwards, and Voules resigned.  He went away to take
a holiday, and a few weeks later received a letter from
Mr. Labouchere asking him to come and see him.  This was the
beginning of an intimate association which lasted till Voules's
death in 1909.  An agreement was entered into under which
Voules was to be "manager" of <i>Truth</i> at a very modest salary,
though with a percentage of the profits which ultimately
proved very valuable; and this agreement was the only one
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P494"></a>494}</span>
ever concluded between the proprietor and his second-in-command,
although for the last twenty-five years of Voules's
life the whole editorial and financial control of the paper was
in his hands alone.  Another point of interest is that to meet
the expenses of the new paper Mr. Labouchere opened a
special account with his bankers and paid into it the sum of
£1000.  Some time later, when the growth of the business
necessitated more capital, this sum was increased to £1500;
but for the first few years £1000 was the whole of the capital
that Mr. Labouchere invested in his venture, and practically
it was never touched; that is to say, the account which he
opened in 1876 with that credit remained with at least that
amount to its credit until he sold the paper in 1910.  From
those details it may be gathered that neither the proprietor
nor his manager regarded themselves as entering upon an
enterprise of any great pith or moment, or imagined that
they were founding a journal which would become famous
over the whole world.  It certainly did not occur to Horace
Voules, then an ambitious and remarkably successful young
man of thirty-two, that in becoming "manager" of this
undertaking at £600 a year he was taking a position that
would occupy him for the rest of his days.
</p>

<p>
In such circumstances the first number of <i>Truth</i> made its
appearance in the first week of 1877.  It was a decided success,
as success in that class of journals was reckoned at that date,
though the sale of the first number was only a fraction of the
figures reached fifteen or twenty years later.  What was of
more consequence, and perhaps more surprising, the second
and following numbers were equally successful; for the
production of a new journal is rather like the production of a
new play&mdash;a full and enthusiastic house on the first night
does not necessarily mean a long run.  Horace Voules was
fond of boasting that <i>Truth</i> had paid its way from the first,
and some of the credit of that result was undoubtedly due
to his great business abilities.  Mr. Labouchere had not
gone into the venture with any idea of making money.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P495"></a>495}</span>
He knew the history of the early difficulties of the <i>World</i>,
which have been referred to in an earlier chapter of this
volume, and it was probably an agreeable surprise to him
that he was not called upon to meet a loss on the first few
months' working of <i>Truth</i>.  In an interview which appeared
in one of the monthly magazines a few years ago, Voules
described the scepticism with which his chief received the
balance-sheet presented to him at the end of the first six
months.  It appeared to Labouchere too good to be true,
and he exercised his ingenuity in attempts to demolish it.
In later years his attitude towards balance-sheets was very
different.
</p>

<p>
The combination of Labouchere and Voules was a very
powerful one.  Few newspapers have ever had a more
remarkable pair of brains and personalities behind them&mdash;the
one acute, ready-witted, audacious, irresponsible, intent
only upon amusing himself and amusing his readers; the
other long-headed, business-like, strenuous, and pushful,
intent only upon making money.  The time came when <i>Truth</i>
owed everything to the guidance and inspiration of Horace
Voules; but at the start it was Mr. Labouchere who made the
paper.  This can easily be seen on looking back to the files
of the journal during the first two or three years of its
existence.  There was nothing very striking or sensational in the
matter of its contents; in form and substance it did not differ
materially from the journals of the same class that had
preceded and followed it.  But the hand and spirit of Labouchere
were all over it, and gave it a character and individuality
which were bound to make the fortune of any journal.  His
literary activity at this period was amazing.  As Voules used
to say, he was exactly like a child with a new toy; and after
playing with many toys he had found the one which exactly
suited him, for the handling of a pen was his greatest joy.
"He would have written the whole paper if he could," said
Voules.  In point of fact for a time he did write a
considerable part of it every week.  He poured out amusing
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P496"></a>496}</span>
paragraphic commentaries on every subject of the moment
that interested him, and flooded the paper with droll
reminiscences of his own adventures and the innumerable
distinguished people whom he had met in all parts of the world.
He "did" the dramatic criticism, and he never did anything
better; in this owing much, no doubt, to his personal
experience as a theatrical manager.  He wrote every week a
"City" article&mdash;a very unconventional kind of City article,
quite unlike any product of financial journalism before or
since.  It broke out occasionally in the most unexpected
directions; for example, one finds an irresistibly comic
account of his experiences among brigands in Mexico cropping
up in a survey of the financial position of that country.
Starting on another occasion to discuss the merits of
Greek stocks, he lapses into a disquisition upon the character
of the modern Greeks, especially the peasantry, illuminated
by reminiscences of his travels in their country.  One of the
funniest things he ever wrote&mdash;a detailed account of his
journey through the Holy Land with the Rev. J. M. Bellew&mdash;made
its appearance as an integral part of a critique of some
new play.  The connecting link between the two things was
that Mr. Bellew's son, the late Mr. Kyrle Bellew, had made
his debut on that first night.  It is only when a man writes
for his own paper that he can do this sort of thing; what
would be the emotions of any normal editor on receiving from
his dramatic critic a three-column narrative of a journey in
Palestine as part of a notice of Mr. Bernard Shaw's last
masterpiece!  It was the spontaneity, this unexpectedness,
the evident absence of all premeditation or effort, as well as
a sort of irresponsible indifference to the ostensible business
of the moment, that gave such a piquancy to Mr. Labouchere's
writing, as it did to his conversation.  It was
something quite new in journalism, and it remains to this
moment absolutely unique.
</p>

<p>
Another characteristic of Mr. Labouchere's which gave a
peculiar flavour to <i>Truth</i> was his frankness and disregard for
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P497"></a>497}</span>
the <i>convenances</i> in speaking about his contemporaries.  He
had no taste for mere tittle-tattle and scandal-mongering in
print.  Prying into the private life of well-known people
was rather a weakness of the "society journals" of the day,
among which <i>Truth</i> was classed, and Mr. Labouchere never
favoured it.  But it must be admitted that in private
conversation he was an inveterate gossip, always well-posted
in whatever talk was current to the discredit of anybody
sufficiently known to be talked about; and when he found
occasion to speak about any person in print, all that he knew
about that person was apt to come out, with precisely the
same unconventional frankness that distinguished his own
personal confessions.  Added to this he was not only
contemptuous of pretence, sham, and humbug in every shape,
hating "snobbism" in its widest sense as heartily as Thackeray
himself, but he was hopelessly devoid of the spirit of
reverence, even in regard to matters that usually receive
reverence on their merits.  Nothing was sacred to him.
He seemed to discover instinctively the seamy side of what
other people admire, and to find a delight in calling attention
to it; and this mischievous habit of mind displayed itself
in his handling of men as well as things.  Introduced into
journalism, and fortified with an extensive knowledge of life
picked up in the diplomatic service, the theatrical world and
the city, and in the ordinary social intercourse of a man of
good family related on all sides to distinguished people,
Mr. Labouchere's natural bent of mind and freedom of speech
led to the embellishment of <i>Truth</i> almost every week with
candid observations upon contemporary personages, which
might be open to criticism on the score of taste, but which
made extremely entertaining reading.
</p>

<p>
Inevitably his pen got him into trouble.  The only
wonder is that the trouble was not more serious, and for
this it may be safely assumed that Mr. Labouchere was much
indebted to Mr. Horace Voules.  After a very few weeks
working together, the two men became very intimate friends,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P498"></a>498}</span>
and Mr. Labouchere, who rarely erred in his reading of men,
acquired a great respect for Voules's judgment, so much so
that, in characteristic fashion, he speedily turned over to his
friend all sorts of business quite unrelated to <i>Truth</i>.  Voules
himself was essentially a fighting man, as he showed when he
obtained control of <i>Truth</i>, but he had the mind of a lawyer
as well as a man of business, and he had&mdash;though it may
sound paradoxical&mdash;a much greater interest in the profit
of the paper than the proprietor himself.  From the first,
although nominally only concerned with the commercial side
of <i>Truth</i>, he read in proof every line of the paper, and he was
not the man to allow the proprietor or anybody else to tumble
accidentally into an indefensible libel action.  He used to
say that he had often saved his chief from that fate, and no
one who knew them both would doubt him.  Another thing
which often saved Mr. Labouchere was his invariable
readiness to apologise to anybody whom he had unintentionally
annoyed or injured.  He did so on many occasions in the
early years of <i>Truth</i>, and he would always do it if he was
approached in the right way.  Not only this, but if he was
once persuaded that he had been too hard on a man, or that
what he had intended as mere play had seriously wounded
the subject of his playfulness, he would often try afterwards
to make amends.  In more than one instance he became
quite friendly with people whom he had more or less insulted
before he knew them.  For better or worse, it was one of the
cardinal traits of Mr. Labouchere's character that he was
incapable of strong emotion, and, among others, of personal
malice.  In one or two instances he conceived rather strong
antipathies to individuals&mdash;not without reason&mdash;but it was
entirely foreign to his nature to hurt a man for the sake of
hurting him; and a most remarkable thing about him was
that while he would strenuously attack a man's conduct or
ridicule unmercifully his speech or actions, he was quite
capable of meeting the same man in a perfectly friendly
spirit, and discussing what had been done on one side and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P499"></a>499}</span>
said on the other, not only without heat, but with a sincere
sympathy for the victim of his pen.  This trait was essential
in his character&mdash;a result of that philosophic interest in his
fellow creatures which caused him to look at all of them alike
without any conventional bias in favour of one mode of life
or action rather than another.  If he had encountered a
burglar in his house already loaded with valuables, his first
impulse would have been, not to call the police, but to engage
the intruder in conversation, and to learn from him something
of the habits of burglars, the latest and most scientific
methods of burgling, the average profits of the business, and
so forth.  He would have been delighted to assist his new
acquaintance with suggestions for his future guidance in his
profession, and to point out to him how he might have
avoided the mistake which had on this occasion led to his
being caught in the act.  In all this he would not by any
means have lost sight of his property; on the contrary, the
whole force of his intellect would have been surreptitiously
occupied with the problem of recovering it with the least
amount of inconvenience to his friend and himself.  He
would have manœuvred to bring off a deal.  If by sweet
reasonableness he could have persuaded the burglar to give
up the "swag," he would have been delighted to hand him
a sovereign or two, cheer him with refreshment, shake hands,
and wish him better luck next time; and he would have
related the whole story in the next week's <i>Truth</i> with infinite
humour and profound satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
This is scarcely an effort of imagination.  Something
very similar happened in <i>Truth</i> office in the 'nineties long
after Mr. Labouchere had ceased to take any active interest
in his paper.  A money-lender who had been severely, but
not unjustly, handled in <i>Truth</i>, insisted upon seeing
Mr. Labouchere personally.  By that time Horace Voules was
the only person who ever saw anybody who had business
with the editor, but he happened to be away, and Labouchere
consented to see the man.  The money-lender arrived in a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P500"></a>500}</span>
most truculent mood; but he was quickly disarmed by
Labouchere's ignorance&mdash;perfectly genuine&mdash;of the nature of
his grievance, and beguiled into telling his story with artless
confidence.  What threatened at first to be a heated wrangle
developed into a friendly interchange of views, in which
Mr. Labouchere, showing a keen scientific interest in
money-lending operations, explained to his visitor exactly where he
was at fault in the management of his business, and gave
him a few practical hints which might assist him to make
larger profits without exposing himself to unfavourable
remark.  The man seemed extremely pleased with the valuable
advice he received, and it was his own fault if he did not
depart very much the wiser for the interview.  When
Mr. Labouchere was writing at large in the early days of <i>Truth</i>,
he made a great many people extremely angry, and some
never forgave him.  But to be angry with him if you met him
face to face was only possible for the very stupid.  Some
few years ago the late Mr. John Kensit made an unsuccessful
application to the High Court to commit the proprietor of
<i>Truth</i> for contempt.  Considering all that had been said
about him in the paper, he had considerable ground for not
loving its proprietor, even if he had been aware, which he
was not, that Mr. Labouchere had never had a hand in what
had been said about him.  But they sat next to one another
in the well of the court during the hearing of the motion,
and by the time the case was on they were chatting and
laughing together like old friends.  "Good-bye, Mr. Labouchere,
said the Protestant champion at the end of the proceedings.
"This has been quite a pleasant meeting."  "I hope you
have enjoyed it as much as I have," answered Labby.
"I am sorry that you have got to pay for it."  And they
shook hands affectionately.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, Mr. Labouchere had a certain
combativeness of disposition, and he was from the first bent
upon using <i>Truth</i> for the exposure of abuses and frauds on the
public.  Consequently, in a certain number of cases he
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P501"></a>501}</span>
deliberately laid himself out to attack individuals, regardless
of the penalties of the law of libel.  His journal had not been
in existence many months before an action was commenced
by Mr. Robertson, the manager of the Royal Aquarium at
Westminster.  Mr. Labouchere was a director of the company
owning that place, and he wrote very fully and frankly
about its affairs in <i>Truth</i>&mdash;in particular a humorous account
in his best manner, of an altercation between Robertson
and himself in the fair at Boulogne.  The circumstances of
the action are of no interest now; but the case is memorable
as the first of the long series of libel actions that <i>Truth</i> has
successfully defended in the course of its existence, and further
as the occasion of one of the earliest forensic successes of
Charles Russell, afterwards Lord Russell of Killowen, and
an intimate friend of Mr. Labouchere's for the rest of his life.
Russell had not at that time taken silk, and was little known,
but Mr. George Lewis (as he then was) and Mr. Labouchere
had sufficient confidences in his abilities to brief him without
a leader, and the experiment was fully justified by the result.
The next legal proceeding in which Mr. Labouchere involved
himself was a <i>cause célèbre</i> of the first dimensions&mdash;his
prosecution by the proprietor of the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> on account
of a series of persistent and, it must be confessed, somewhat
vicious attacks upon the management of that journal.
Mr. Labouchere elected to defend himself, and he has rarely
acquitted himself in public with more address than he did
on that occasion, though he had a good deal of useful
assistance from the late Lord Justice Bowen, then a stuff
gowns-man, who was briefed for the printers of the paper.  There
is no occasion at this date to revive other circumstances of
this personal encounter between two eminent representatives
of journalism.  The jury disagreed, the case was not brought
to trial again, and the hatchet was buried.  Mr. Labouchere
was released on his own recognisances, and many years later
he used to be fond of explaining that he was still in that
condition.  Apparently he remained in it till his death.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P502"></a>502}</span>
</p>

<p>
One other libel case of Mr. Labouchere's early journalistic
days may be recalled for the sake of the very characteristic
accident out of which it arose.  Mr. Labouchere had written
something extremely dangerous.  Voules noted it on the
proof, and after a consultation between them Mr. Labouchere
agreed to take the passage out.  He accordingly drew his
pen through two or three of the incriminating lines, or
rather he attempted to do so; but his pen always worked in
rather an erratic way, and the marks he made on the proof
were as much under the words as through them.  The
consequence was that the printer misunderstood the intention,
and the libellous passage which had alarmed Voules not only
appeared in the paper, but appeared with the additional
emphasis of italics!  This was one of the accidents which had
to be repaired with an apology, though this did not prevent
the issue of a writ.  If any other actions for libel were
commenced in the early years of Mr. Labouchere's editorship
they did not lead to serious fighting, and there was nothing
in them worth recalling now.  But he certainly contrived
in the course of three or four years to give his paper a great
reputation for courageous plain speaking, and to convey the
impression that its proprietor was a dangerous man to fall
foul of, and a difficult man to tackle successfully.
</p>

<p>
As for his work as an editor during that time, he seems to
have taken it very easily after the first few weeks.  "I will
give him six months," Edmund Yates was reported to have
said when his friend was beginning with such a big splash;
and the thought was not begotten of a wish, but of Yates's
knowledge of his late contributor.  The fatal weakness of
Mr. Labouchere's character&mdash;certainly during the second
forty years of his life, and probably during the first forty&mdash;was
incapacity for sustained effort.  He quickly grew tired
of everything he took in hand, and he hated drudgery and
routine work.  Horace Voules used to relate his amazement
at the zest with which his chief, at the first start, threw
himself into the work of reading copy and proofs, and criticising
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P503"></a>503}</span>
and planning improvements in the paper when it was
produced; and his equal amazement at the process by which
such editorial functions were one by one delegated to the
so-called "manager," never again to be resumed.  The
same story is told by others who were familiar with the
inside of <i>Truth</i> office during its early days.  From the first
Voules's position was that of an assistant-editor, and in
the course of a year or two he became very much more of an
editor than an assistant, while the editor lapsed into the
position of an adviser and an indefatigable contributor.  It
must have been in 1878 or 1879 that Voules went away for
a holiday on the Continent, and received a letter in which
Mr. Labouchere informed him that there was very little
going on, and added, "I do not think I shall bring the paper
out next week."  Voules believed him to be perfectly capable
of this enormity, and the mere thought of it filled him
with such dismay that he came back to London by the next
train.  "You need not have worried yourself so about it,"
said Mr. Labouchere when his colleague reached the office.
"Probably I should have brought the paper out all right."  But,
unlike his employer, Voules was very given to worrying
himself, and this incident worried him so much that he never
left the proprietor in charge of his own paper again.  At
holiday times he used always to take a house within easy
reach of London, and it is a fact that for fourteen or fifteen
years, until he had his first bad illness, he never missed seeing
<i>Truth</i> to press himself.  This little incident, so very
characteristic of Mr. Labouchere, at least serves to justify the
observation that he soon learned to take his editorial functions
lightly; and it shows the waning of the zest with which
he had taken up the "new toy" a year or two previously.
</p>

<p>
Until the general election of 1880, Mr. Labouchere
remained regular in his attendance at the office, and actively
interested in the affairs of his journal if his principal work
for it was purely literary.  But after he was returned for
Northampton and began to make a figure in Parliament, which
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P504"></a>504}</span>
he did almost from the first, <i>Truth</i> began to have a secondary
place in his affections.  In the course of the next year or two
he seems to have gradually relinquished the entire editorial
control into Voules's hands.  He ceased to supply dramatic
criticism, and to write with any regularity on city matters.
On the other hand, he naturally began to write regularly on
politics, which up to that time he had done only now and then
and without expressing any strong opinions.  At that date
the connection between the Press and Parliament was much
less intimate than it has since become.  The journalistic
M.P., so familiar a figure in recent years, was virtually
unknown.  There were only two or three newspaper
proprietors in the House of Commons; none in the House of
Lords.  The descriptive reporter had not yet made his
appearance in the Press Gallery; the gentlemen there were
shorthand writers only.  The Lobby correspondent had not
risen to that public importance for which he was destined.
Mr. Labouchere consequently had the field very much to
himself as a parliamentary journalist.  Perhaps he did not
make as much use of the opportunity as he would have done
three or four years earlier, when journalism for its own sake
had such a hold upon his affections.  He was always
extremely averse to using his parliamentary position for the
advantage of his own paper; indeed, so far did he carry this
feeling that in later years when any matter was under
ventilation in <i>Truth</i>, which naturally furnished matter for
the interrogation of a Minister, it was most difficult to obtain
his assistance, and quite impossible to persuade him to ask
a question himself.  If he consented to give his help, he
nearly always got a friend to put the question down.  From
first to last&mdash;to the intense annoyance of Horace Voules&mdash;his
disposition was always to use his own journal as an aid
to his schemes and ambitions in Parliament, never his
parliamentary position for the advantage of his journal.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, the reputation that he speedily made for
himself in the House of Commons, his novel and individual
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P505"></a>505}</span>
style of handling politics and politicians&mdash;friends and foes
alike&mdash;and the audacity of the opinions which he was
always delivering with an air "that was childlike and bland,"
necessarily had their effect upon the paper that he owned
and wrote for.  As the organ of a rising M.P., constantly
before the public, and a mouthpiece of advanced Radicalism,
<i>Truth</i> gained more than it lost by the cessation of
Mr. Labouchere's exuberant literary activity.  The circulation
of the paper, which had not increased to any great extent
between 1877 and 1880, now began to display considerable
buoyancy.  At the same time Horace Voules was beginning
to make his hand felt.  He enlisted many useful recruits to
fill the space left vacant by Mr. Labouchere.  In particular
he developed the paper on the financial side, having a strong
fancy, as well as great aptitude, for that line of journalism.
In fact he may be considered a pioneer in it, for at that time
there was not a single financial daily paper in London, and
the financial articles in the general daily Press were framed
in a very bald and perfunctory style.  With the assistance
of Mr. L. Brousson, who wrote for <i>Truth</i> with most valuable
results for nearly twenty years under the pseudonym of
"Moses Moss," Voules made the paper as strong in finance
as Mr. Labouchere made it in politics, and very much more
popular.  Voules was a man of great enterprise, courage, and
resource, a sound judge of "what the public wants," and at
the same time a born fighter.  He wrote little himself, but
he had a good eye for literary ability in others&mdash;at any rate
the kind of ability that he needed for his own purpose.
Following up the lead which Mr. Labouchere had given in
attacking frauds and abuses, he made during the 'eighties
several big journalistic coups by the exposure of financial
swindles.  From this he passed on to the fertile field of
charity.  By this time he had got together a fairly complete
and competent staff for dealing with such matters.  He made
a thorough investigation of every subject he dealt with.  He
interviewed witnesses himself; he inspired every line that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P506"></a>506}</span>
was written for publication.  Thus fortified, he threw down
the gauntlet to one swindler after another.  Many were
routed and driven out of the field by the mere force of the
case made against them in <i>Truth</i>.  Others, who defended
themselves by proceedings for libel, were met and overthrown
one after another in the Law Courts.  The story of all these
personal encounters, which lasted almost continuously for
ten or twelve years, would fill a volume&mdash;and a volume
without any parallel in the history of journalism.  The work
ended only because there was no more to be done.  There
was no game left worth powder and shot.  Horace Voules
had simply cleared out this particular field.  Nor was his
activity confined to any one field.  The public
services&mdash;particularly the Army&mdash;the Church, the administration of
justice, especially by justices of the peace, and indeed almost
every sphere of human activity where there was any wrong
or misconduct that required castigation, brought perennial
supplies of grist to the journalistic mill over which Horace
Voules ruled in Carteret Street.
</p>

<p>
Thus it came about that towards the end of the last
century <i>Truth</i> had become a journal with a unique record,
an influence that was felt&mdash;mostly for good&mdash;all over the
English-speaking world, and incidentally a very valuable
property.  Before the end of the 'eighties it must have begun
to yield Mr. Labouchere&mdash;a rich man independently of it&mdash;a
larger income than would have sufficed for all his
requirements, which were never extravagant.  The attitude of the
parent towards his bantling, which had grown in such an
unexpected fashion, was very much like his attitude towards
everything else that happened to him in life.  If he took any
pride in his offspring, he did not manifest it openly; in a
general way he betrayed no concern in its performances.
When he visited the office, which he usually did for an hour
or two on Monday and Tuesday mornings on his way to the
House of Commons, it was only to correct the proofs of his
own contributions&mdash;by this time almost entirely confined
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P507"></a>507}</span>
to politics, except when he went abroad in the autumn&mdash;to
consume a frugal lunch, and to chat about anything but the
business of his paper with anybody whom he could find to
talk to.
</p>

<p>
A personal reminiscence of this period will show how
strangely uninterested he was in the affairs of the paper which
he was supposed by the public to direct.  In the spring of
1893, Horace Voules had a bad illness, the first of many, and
as he kept the whole business of the office in his hands the
situation was rather serious.  I went down to see him at
Brighton, where he lived for the last twenty years of his life,
and heard from his doctor that if he ever came back at all it
could not be for many weeks.  On returning to town I went
straight to the House of Commons and reported this alarming
intelligence to Mr. Labouchere.  If I had reported it to
the Speaker he could not have manifested less concern.
What chiefly interested Mr. Labouchere was the nature and
treatment of Voules's ailment; he was always prepared to
give advice, publicly or privately, on the preservation of
health.  "You know Voules eats a great deal too much," he
said, which was no doubt true.  "His doctor should do so and
so.  I will write to him at once."  I suggested to him that
it might be more useful if he would write something for <i>Truth</i>,
as we had not an editorial article in sight for next week.
"You can do very well for once without an article, can't
you?" was the staggering reply.  I endeavoured to convey
to him that there was a great deal of work at the office which
somebody would have to do in Voules's absence, among
other things about fifty letters a day requiring to be attended
to.  "I should not bother myself about answering letters
if I were you," said my employer.  This did not surprise
me so much, for I had previously heard from Voules of our
proprietor's golden rule for dealing with correspondence: "I
never knew a letter yet, Voules, which would not answer
itself if you left it alone for two months."  It did not take
many minutes' conversation to show that the editor was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P508"></a>508}</span>
quite the last person from whom any assistance was likely to
be obtained in carrying on the paper in the emergency that
had arisen; at the same time I remember that we had a very
interesting talk about the Home Rule Bill before I left him.
I wondered afterwards what he would have said if I had
written to him in his own words to Voules, "I don't think I
shall bring the paper out next week."  Probably it would
not have disturbed him seriously.  It should be added that
he did write to Voules as he had promised&mdash;a very kind,
sympathetic letter, in which he begged Voules above all
things not to hurry back, and assured him that everything
would go on all right in his absence.  I forget whether he
said that he would see to that, but it is quite possible that he
did.  It is a fact that the following week&mdash;the first in which
Voules had been absent for about fifteen years&mdash;Mr. Labouchere
also omitted his customary visit to the office on a
Monday morning.  I suppose he thought that as Voules was
away I should not have much time to talk to him.
</p>

<p>
To those who were behind the scenes there was something
ludicrous and something supremely "Laboucherean" in the
contrast between this airy indifference to the fortunes of his
journal, and the public conception of the proprietor as an
indefatigable editor personally inspiring and directing all its
performances.  Possibly it amused Mr. Labouchere himself,
but far more probably he never gave it a thought, for nothing
in his life that appeared to other people abnormal ever
presented itself in that light to him.  To any one who knows
the <i>laissez-aller</i> spirit in which he treated every affair of life,
it cannot cause the slightest surprise that he allowed himself
to drift into a position which was, on the face of it, somewhat
equivocal.  The best evidence of the view that he himself
took of this anomalous position is afforded by the way it
came to an end.  Horace Voules chafed for a long time under
his own relation to the titular editor, and it is really more
difficult to understand his long acceptance of this position
than Mr. Labouchere's failure to do anything towards
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P509"></a>509}</span>
altering it.  The explanation in his case, no doubt, is that
with the growth of the profits of the business he gradually
came into a very handsome income, and he was a man who
valued this a good deal more than personal glory.  But he
certainly felt aggrieved, as most men would, that so much of
the credit of his work should go to another, and what
perhaps annoyed him more was Mr. Labouchere's characteristic
indifference to everything that was done in his name.  Out
of this there grew up a coolness between them, and at last
Voules openly kicked.  The moment the question of the
editorship was raised in this way, Mr. Labouchere instantly
conceded it, as Voules might have known he would.  "My
dear Voules," he said, in mild surprise.  "<i>I</i> don't want to be
the editor.  You can call yourself the editor if you like."  In
his own mind he probably said, "If you attach any value
to such an absurd trifle, why, in the name of wonder, did
you not say so before?"  In this characteristic fashion,
Mr. Labouchere divested himself of the last rags of editorship.
Voules recounted the conversation to me immediately after
it took place.  I cannot fix the date precisely, but it was
probably in 1897 or 1898.
</p>

<p>
There remains little to be related of Mr. Labouchere's
career as a journalist.  But it may assist the comprehension
of what appears difficult to understand, in his relation to the
real editorship of his paper during so many years, to refer
to what passed between him and Voules on a lamentable
occasion in 1902.  At that time certain unfortunate
circumstances had come to light which made it impossible that
Mr. Brousson should remain on the staff of <i>Truth</i>, or that
Horace Voules should continue in the formal position of
editor; I trust I may be forgiven for referring in mere detail
to the indiscretion of an old and dear friend and the sad end
of a brilliant career.  Mr. Labouchere, to whom the situation
must have been as painful as to anybody, took counsel with
Sir George Lewis, as a friend of both parties, and between
them they excogitated an announcement for publication to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P510"></a>510}</span>
the effect that Mr. Voules had resigned the editorship of
<i>Truth</i>, but would remain associated with the paper.  It was
the least that could have been announced under the
circumstances, but naturally poor Voules fought hard against it,
and a warm debate took place at Sir George Lewis's office.
Voules wanted to know who was to be appointed editor, and
in what capacity he himself was to be "associated with the
paper."  He declined to submit to the humiliation of having
to serve under one of his own subordinates.  Mr. Labouchere
told him that he did not see the necessity of appointing
another editor.  "You can't seriously propose that the paper
is to be carried on without an editor," said Voules.  "My
dear Voules," replied the proprietor, "I have now been
connected with newspapers over forty years, and I have never
yet discovered what an editor is.  If you like, I will resume
the editorship, but it seems to me quite unnecessary."  So
little did Voules understand his old friend even at that
date that he came to me at the end of the interview in a
terrible state of agitation, convinced that Labouchere was
playing with him, and that he and I were to change places.
Labouchere was, of course, perfectly serious, and for the
next seven years <i>Truth</i> remained without an editor.  I
suppose that in all his life Mr. Labouchere never did a more
extraordinary thing than this, judging by what would be
considered ordinary conduct for a man in his position in such
a case.  Yet surely the extraordinary course which he took
is an example of the way in which his habit of looking at
the essential things in life, and snapping his fingers at
conventions and traditions, guided him to the best possible
solution of a serious difficulty.  He regarded it as essential
that Voules should not be formally and officially the man
in control of the paper.  He regarded it as equally
essential&mdash;but how few would have done so!&mdash;that the man who had
served him so well and honourably for five-and-twenty
years should not be cast out to end his days in disgrace.  So
he said: "I will have no editor in future.  I see no necessity
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P511"></a>511}</span>
for it.  Manage as best you can without one!"  Is not this
really a stroke of genius, seeing that it is a solution of the
difficulty that no one else would ever have dreamed of, that
it is so perfectly simple, and that it effected everything that
was really necessary?  It also becomes easier, I think, after
this to understand how Mr. Labouchere had previously
allowed his paper to go on for about seventeen years under
the editorship of its business "manager" without suspecting
that there was anything anomalous in this arrangement until
his manager surprised him by protesting against it.
</p>

<p>
I feel that I cannot close this narrative of Mr. Labouchere's
relations with <i>Truth</i> without a reference to the
termination of his sole proprietorship of that journal, for it
was very characteristic of him.  Slight as was the interest
that he evinced in his property in his later years, he never
seemed desirous of parting with it, naming a prohibitive price
when any one offered to buy it, as many did, including
Horace Voules.  When, after poor Voules's death in 1909,
I myself pressed him to turn his proprietorship into a
company, he politely but firmly declined, observing that he
distrusted boards, and had always believed in finding a man
who can manage your business for you and leaving him to do
it.  Undoubtedly that was the principle on which he had
conducted many of his affairs.  But in the end I ventured to
suggest to him that it would be a great kindness to me and
other members of his staff, who had been connected with
the paper for many years, if he could see his way to put the
proprietorship on a permanent footing, and save us from the
possible results of a sale of the paper to the first bidder in
the event of his predeceasing us.  His response was
instantaneous and most sympathetic.  He practically offered me
an option on the paper at half the price he had asked Voules
a few years previously, and interested himself warmly in
explaining to me how I was to turn this opportunity to the
best advantage.  When the proposed deal did not promise to
come off very speedily, he finally said that he would waive
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P512"></a>512}</span>
his objections to converting himself into a mere shareholder,
and leave us to form a company, taking from him or placing
with others such shares as we could.  So ended Mr. Labouchere's
proprietorship of <i>Truth</i>&mdash;in an act of pure kindness of
heart.  It is an exact parallel to his easy-going abdication
of the editorship at the first hint from Voules that the
existing position was rather hard on him.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Labouchere was a man of most extraordinary character.
"He was an extraordinary person!" is the exclamation
that one has heard a hundred times rising involuntarily
to the lips of those who knew him well.  The story of his
connection with journalism is an extraordinary one, but as
loosely sketched in the foregoing reminiscences it can give
but an inadequate impression of what was most remarkable
about him.  This would be equally true of any mere narrative
of the events of his career, or any collection of his
disjointed utterances.  In writing of him one is always in
danger of conveying the impression that he was a mere
eccentric or freak.  In reality he was something very much
more.  Among other things he was one of the most prolific
and spontaneous writers that ever lived, and everything that
he wrote, however trivial the subject, bore some mark of
his own unique personality.  His love of his pen was perhaps
his most vital characteristic; it resembled, indeed, his love of
his cigarette, and the two affections always came into play
simultaneously.  He would take up a pen anywhere, and
commit his thoughts to paper without regard to external
circumstances&mdash;during a debate in the House of Commons,
during a children's party in Old Palace Yard, in a public
room of an hotel.  When abroad on his holidays he used to
write contributions to <i>Truth</i> as regularly as if he were under
contract to supply so much copy each week&mdash;evidently
writing purely as a pleasure.  Probably Mr. Labouchere is
the only man who ever wrote for publication, systematically
and voluminously, without ever being paid for what he
wrote.  Indirectly, of course, as the proprietor of <i>Truth</i>,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P513"></a>513}</span>
he profited by his contributions to his own paper; but
nobody who knew him will suppose that this consideration
ever presented itself to him as a motive for exertion.  Neither
was he actuated by that common weakness, love of seeing
himself in print.  On the contrary, what became of anything
he wrote after he had produced it was a matter of profound
indifference to him.  "I am the only person, I believe, on
the Press," he wrote in his later days, in answer to an apology
for consigning to oblivion a rather long-winded article
forwarded from Florence, "who does not care in the least
whether his lucubrations do or do not appear in print."  He
wrote to me many times in the same strain, and it was
no doubt literally true.  Frequently he would write an
article and omit to post it; sometimes he mislaid it
permanently, sometimes he accidentally destroyed it.  Sometimes
he would send a second edition of an article already received
and printed, explaining that he could not remember whether
he had posted the first edition or torn it up by mistake.
From long experience of him, I doubt whether he ever looked
at anything he had written after it was printed and
published, unless some accidental circumstance gave him
occasion to refer to it.
</p>

<p>
No man who ever wrote more strikingly exemplified the
aphorism "<i>le style c'est l'homme</i>."  His style was entirely
his own&mdash;a pure, spontaneous growth, neither derived from
reading, nor formed by conscious effort.  It reflected as
vividly as his conversation the characteristics of his intellect,
his lucidity of thought and expression, his quick apprehension,
his distaste for display, his unconventional habit of mind, his
dry humour, his naïve wit.  A very good judge, and an old
acquaintance in Parliament, writing of him in the <i>Saturday
Review</i> after his death, said that "Mr. Labouchere's prose
was Voltairian."  It was Voltairian because his mind was
Voltairian, and because he reproduced on paper, instinctively
and without effort, exactly what was in his mind.  But it is
out of place to speak of anything that Mr. Labouchere did
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P514"></a>514}</span>
in terms of uncritical eulogy.  On the technical side
Mr. Labouchere's literary work was marred by the failings which
beset him in everything he undertook&mdash;his repugnance to
"taking trouble," and his supreme indifference.  Although
he would overhaul his proof mercilessly, and go on doing it
as often as a proof was submitted to him, the process was
generally that of expanding and rewriting, rarely of touching
up and improving what he had written.  He thought as
little about "polishing up" a sentence for the sake of literary
effect as of brushing his hat before he went for a walk.  The
consequence was that the inevitable blemishes in the work
of a man who wrote so fluently, but never had the patience
to read and correct his own manuscript, constantly made
their appearance in print.  No one who reads his work,
knowing the way it was done, can doubt that he had it in
him to enrich English literature with veritable masterpieces.
It was the will that he lacked, not the ability, and so it was
with nearly everything he undertook.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Labouchere was a man of genius&mdash;genius real,
original, and many-sided.  The signs of it are evident in
almost everything he did, including his mistakes and his
eccentricities.  But he had the misfortune to be born very
rich, and if he was not by nature indolent he acquired an
indolent habit of mind through never being under the necessity
of exerting his powers to their full capacity.  His genius
was of the critical, not the creative order, and this also
contributed to his forming a view of life inconsistent with
strenuous exertion, for it led him to despise nearly everything
that men ordinarily prize, success in all its shapes included.
During all the time I knew him, his attitude towards life
was that of a man playing a game, interested in it certainly,
but only for the amusement it afforded him.  It is worthy of
note that he confesses to having been in youth an inveterate
gambler, and having given up play because he found that it
was acquiring too much hold over him.  To be interested in
everything, but too much interested in nothing, was a cardinal
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P515"></a>515}</span>
principle of his life.  Few men have ever incurred more
obloquy, and many worthy people regarded him with
aversion; but it was only from misunderstanding or lack of
knowledge.  To this he himself contributed by his perverse
habit of self-depreciation, his indifference to the opinions of
his fellow-men, and the amusement he found in mystifying
them.  It is absurd to put him on a pedestal&mdash;a position
which he never allowed any one else, and which he took good
care to show he never desired for himself.  But it was
impossible to be much in contact with him without
appreciating that he was a being of a rare order of intellect,
with something in him that placed him above the ordinary
failings and foibles of humanity, however much he might
try to magnify his own.  It was my privilege to know him
pretty closely for over thirty years, and very intimately for
the last ten.  Though he did in that time many things that
one would have wished he had not done, and said many that
would have been better left unsaid, I can look back to him
now only with admiration for his wisdom and his wit, and
affection for his drolleries and his indiscretions, no less than
for his many virtues.
</p>

<p>
There comes back to me the last time I sat with him, by
the side of the lake at Cadennabia.  "Let us get away from
this beastly band," he had said, in the hall of the hotel after
dinner, "one can't hear oneself speak."  So we sat down
outside, and he rambled on: "I can't think why people
want bands when they come here.  Wonderful place this
for stars!  What I like about it is that you can see them in
the lake without craning your neck.  I sit here and follow
Bacon's advice: look at the stars in the pond instead of in
the sky, and you won't tumble into the pond.  There was a
Greek named Pythagoras&mdash;or some ass at any rate&mdash;who
comforted himself with the notion that in the future state
he would be able to hear the music of the spheres.  Who
wants to hear the music of the spheres?  Bother that band!
What strikes me most about the stars is that they do their
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P516"></a>516}</span>
work so quietly.  Pythagoras picked up his notions in the
East&mdash;probably from the Jews.  They imagined angels with
harps and a perpetual concert in heaven.  Good God!
Think of having to sit at a concert for all eternity!  Wouldn't
you pray to be allowed to go to hell?  The only reason that
I can see for desiring immortality would be the chance of
meeting Pythagoras and the other asses, and having a few
words with them.  Now Socrates was not an ass.  He was
for banishing musicians from his republic.  No doubt he
saw that this would get him a lot of republican votes.
Gladstone once said to me&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
And then he dropped off to sleep.  He was beginning by
that time to doze at odd times, though all his life it was
characteristic of him not to be able to take his sleep like an
ordinary mortal.  And not long after I left him sitting there
by the lake, sleep finally overcame him, and he passed out
into the night, to learn more of the silence of the stars, and
to have it out, if possible, with Pythagoras.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX
<br><br>
THE CLOSING YEARS
</h3>

<p>
Upon only one occasion in his life could a charge of
Jingoism have been brought against Mr. Labouchere.
The last long speech he made in the House of Commons was
against the second reading of the Women's Enfranchisement
Bill, in which he said that he objected to women being given
the vote because they could not be soldiers; in short, because
their physical limitations prevented them from being able to
take a place in the battlefield.  A member pointed out that
the speaker himself was not a military man.  With passion
he replied that, whereas there was not a man alive who could
not fight, and, if necessary, swim through seas of gore to
protect his native land, the other sex were incapable of
putting up with the hardships and privation involved in
warfare.[<a id="chap19fn1text"></a><a href="#chap19fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p>
It was in the third session of Mr. Balfour's Parliament
that Mr. Labouchere made his last speech in the House of
Commons.  He was nearly seventy-four years old, and had
been hankering for some time after the delights of a reposeful
old age in the retirement of the beautiful villa he had bought
in the neighbourhood of Florence four years before.  Sir
Henry Campbell Bannerman had written to him in the
previous December, when a rumour of his intended retirement
had reached him: "I hope you are not really thinking of
breaking off with Parliament, though I frankly say it is what
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P518"></a>518}</span>
I should do if I could, who have the advantage of a year or
two over you, but I think we old stagers with sound views
are wanted to steady the new-century gentlemen by a little
of our early Victorian wisdom."  But Mr. Labouchere was
wise enough to know how dull it would be to exist in a modern
Parliament as almost the only survivor of the grand old
Victorian Radical party, whose sympathies and ideals, the
policy of the Labour members alone resembled, in the
remotest degree.  His mind was made up, but he kept his own
counsel, except to his leader, because, as he wrote to
Mr. Robert Bennett at the time of his retirement, a man who is
known not to be going to stand again becomes a nonentity
in Parliament.
</p>

<p>
In a letter to Mr. Edward Thornton, the month before
his withdrawal from public life, he gave his view of the
Parliamentary situation at that time:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
Just now politics are dead.  When Parliament meets, the
Liberals will try to put the Government in a majority during the
session, and Balfour will try to carry on to the end of it.  There
seems no reason why he should be beaten, provided that he can
keep his men in the House.  But this is also our difficulty.  The
individual M.P. never wants an election....  Campbell
Bannerman is now absolutely certain to be the next Premier unless
his health breaks down.  All that you see about this or that man
in the Cabinet is only intelligent anticipation.  He is not <i>de jure</i>
on the succession to the Premiership, there are no consultations,
and he has a wholesome distrust of his Front Bench friends who
almost all have intrigued against him.  I know him intimately,
and he talks to me pretty freely, for I have expressed to him that
I want nothing.  At seventy-four a man is a fool to be a Minister.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The news of Mr. Labouchere's retirement came as a
surprise to most of the world.  The first intimation to the
public was his letter to the Liberal electors of Northampton
announcing his decision.  It was written from Florence, and
dated December 14, 1905.  It ran as follows:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P519"></a>519}</span>
</p>

<p class="quote">
GENTLEMEN,&mdash;I have been elected by a majority of you to
represent you in six Parliaments.  I have received no intimation
from any of the Radicals, to whose votes I have owed my having
been your member for twenty-five years, that they disapprove
of my Parliamentary action whilst serving them, or that they do
not wish me to be one of their candidates at the next general
election.  Were I, therefore, to come forward again as a candidate
there is little doubt that I should be one of your representatives
in a seventh Parliament.  But I am now seventy-four years old.
At that age a man is neither so strong nor active as he once was,
and any one who wishes to represent efficiently a large and
important constituency like yours in Parliament should be
strong in wind and limb.  I feel therefore that I ought not to
take advantage of your consideration towards me in a matter
so vital to you in order to lag superfluous on the political stage.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I have delayed until now making this announcement because
it was impossible to know when a general election would take
place, and I thought that it would be more convenient to you
for me to wait until the date of the election was settled and near
at hand.  I do not think that my withdrawal will affect the
position of parties in Northampton.  In Dr. Shipman you have
a member whose Parliamentary action has been in accord with
the pledges that have already secured his return, and on whose
personal worth all are agreed.  You will have no difficulty in
finding a man to replace me, as eager to promote the cause of
democracy as I am, and who will be better able to fight for the
cause than one in the sere and yellow leaf.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Mr. Labouchere remarked once, that he had on one
occasion only been asked by a constituent for a pledge with
regard to his Parliamentary action.  He had unhesitatingly
given it, and been unflinchingly true to his word.  The
elector's injunction had been, "Now, mind, I say, and keep
your hi on Joe."  But whether the story is a slight exaggeration
of the confidence his constituents had in him to faithfully
represent their views at Westminster or not, it gives
elliptically a description of his attitude during the twenty-five
years he served the electors of Northampton.  He became
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P520"></a>520}</span>
their member as an anti-Imperialist, in Lord Beaconsfield's
interpretation of the term, and he took his leave of them
as an anti-Imperialist, in the more modern, and what may
be called "Chamberlain" sense of the word.
</p>

<p>
I shall quote Mr. T. P. O'Connor's farewell on the occasion
of his retirement, which he published under the title of
"The Passing of Labby," for, apart from its literary merit,
it is the fine appreciation of a friend of many years' standing,
who knew the value of Mr. Labouchere from the social as
well as the Parliamentary and journalistic points of view:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
There is no old member of the House of Commons who will not
feel a pang of personal regret at hearing that Labby is leaving that
Assembly.  No one has a right to criticise a man for giving up an
active life at seventy-four years of age&mdash;he has done his work.
But Labby had become an almost essential part of the House of
Commons; and there never will be anybody who can quite take
his place there.  That extraordinary combination of strong party
zeal, with a lurking desire to make mischief; the sardonic and
satirical spirit, mingled with a certain fierce, though carefully
concealed zeal for the public good; the mordant wit that was
equally the delight of the House and of the smoking room; the
world-wide and varied experience of all life in almost every
country and in almost every form&mdash;these are the possessions of
but one man, and his like we shall never see again.  There are
two Labbys.  There is the Labby who almost corrodes with his
bitter wit, and who seems to laugh at everything in life.  There
is the other Labby who has strong, stern purpose, who hates all
shams, all cruelty, all imposture, all folly, and who has made war
on all these things for more than a quarter of a century.  There
is even a third Labby&mdash;the man who hates to give pain even to
a domestic, and who is laughingly said to have run out of a room
rather than face the irritated looks of a maidservant whom he
had summoned by too vigorous a pull at the bell.  One of the
reasons of the popularity Labby enjoyed in the House was his
tolerant amiability.  I have seen him in the smoking room in the
most friendly converse with many a man whom in previous years
he had most fiercely attacked; he bore no ill will, and treated all
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P521"></a>521}</span>
those encounters as demanded by business, and as dismissable
when the fight was over.  Finally Labby was a far straighter,
far more serious, far more effective politician than his own
persiflage would allow people to think.  With all his light wit,
there was something stern and rigid in the man, as you could see
from the powerful mouth, with the full compressed lips.  He was
perfectly honest in his hatred of extravagance, pretence,
vainglory.  He preferred riding in a tramcar to riding in a coach and
four.  He dressed so shabbily sometimes that his counsel used
to have to remonstrate with him when he had to answer a charge
of libel.  He was an ascetic in eating.  Once he dined quite
comfortably, when he was electioneering, on ham sandwiches with
sponge-cake for bread.  He rarely, if ever, tasted wine; he
smoked incessantly the poorest and cheapest cigarettes.  As he
was in private, so he was in public life.  He derided all great
Imperial designs as snobbery and extravagance; he hated
ambition&mdash;in short, he was in both his personal habits and his
public opinions, a true devotee of the simple life.  He did
immense service to his party in his time.  During the heat of the
Home Rule controversy he spoke in scores of towns; took
journeys by night and by day, never spared himself exertion,
never complained of discomfort; in his laughing air, with his
assumed air of languor, he was a strenuous, manly, courageous
fighter.  And he never changed, he never concealed, he never
explained away his opinion upon anything.  And so I bid him
with regret farewell from a scene where he was a model of honest

So Labby goes! [mourned the <i>Morning Post</i>].  What Parliament
and public life will be without him, I hate to think.  The
letter of cheery regrets to his Northampton constituents
subtracts the <i>sauce piquante</i> from the Parliamentary dish.  The
House has long counted Labby as the last of its originals, has
prized him as a refreshing relish, has looked to him for the
unexpected flavour.  All strangers would ask inevitably to have
him pointed out, and the House would fill at once when the word
went round the corridors and lobbies and smoking rooms that
Labby was "up" and holding forth from his customary corner
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P522"></a>522}</span>
seat below the gangway&mdash;the best of all positions from which to
address the House.  So too the smoking room became suddenly
crowded when Labby was to be seen standing there with back
to fireplace, the eternal cigarette between his lips, ready for talk.
It gives a peculiar pang to realise that he will be seen there no
more.  But the pang is lessened when one finds Labby&mdash;Labby
of all men&mdash;seriously pleading old age as a ground for his retirement.
It sounds like one of his little jokes, or, perhaps, it is a
genuine case of hallucination.  Labby had possibly a touch of
old age at twenty, but he had also the sense to outgrow it.  Since
then he has never relapsed, and now in the seventy-fifth year of
his youth, and with a pen several years younger, it is a vain and
commonplace and un-Labbyish thing to pretend that youth and
he are no longer "housemates still."  An unbelieving world will
not accept that plea....  I daresay that, half a century ago,
Labby was, not unlike the wise youth Adrian in Meredith's
<i>Richard Feverel</i>, quite unnaturally cool and quizzical, long-headed
and non-moral, but an Adrian humanised by something of the
Bohemian spirit and a turn for careless pleasuring.  And in those
days, no doubt&mdash;his Eton and Cambridge days&mdash;he struck his
contemporaries as really old.  But no one, for fifty years, has
ever accused him of not having overcome his early weakness;
and it was the very last charge I ever expected to hear Labby
prefer against himself.[<a id="chap19fn3text"></a><a href="#chap19fn3">3</a>]
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
There was something about Mr. Labouchere's personality,
apart from his deeds and thoughts, which appealed almost
irresistibly to the affectionate sympathies of all mankind.
To find an ill-natured comment in any of the articles that
were published about him in the press when he left the House
of Commons is so difficult that, were such a one to be
recorded in this volume, it would give its author an almost
unenviable position of distinction.  But in order to be
perfectly impartial, I shall merely quote the pleasant part
of the only one I could find, so that its writer need not feel
that he has been placed in an out-of-the-way corner with a
fool's cap on his head:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P523"></a>523}</span>
</p>

<p>
On the whole Mr. Labouchere has done a great deal of good
in his life, more good and less evil than many so-called statesmen.
He has exposed swindlers and moneylenders and rotten companies.
He has obtained for the public the right to ride, drive, and
walk up and down Constitution Hill.  No victim of cruelty
or injustice ever appealed to him for a hearing in vain.  Above
all he wrote an English style of remarkable purity, logic, and
humour.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Letters of regretful farewell poured in upon Labby in
his Florentine home, and he possessed a kindly characteristic
common to nearly all frankly unpretentious human beings.
He loved his post.  In his cosy armchair by the fire he read
his letters and enjoyed them, and what was more&mdash;he
proceeded to answer them.  No pre-occupation, however
diverting, ever prevented him from, at the first available
moment sitting down to his writing-table, and, in the almost
illegible hand which he vainly tried to improve, penning
answers to his welcome correspondents.
</p>

<p>
"I have been very sorry, but not surprised," wrote Sir
Henry Campbell Bannerman to him on Christmas Day, "to
read in the newspapers of your retirement.  It is not over
kind of you to put it on the ground of age, for that hits some
of the rest of us hard.  For my part, I confess my sentiment
when I read it was: <i>O si sic omnes</i>&mdash;and envy was the prevailing
feeling.  But, seriously, we shall miss you greatly as one
always ready to hoist the flag of the old Liberalism, as
distinguishable from the less stout and stalwart doctrine which
passes for Liberalism with the moderns.
</p>

<p>
"But now as you are going would you care to have the
House of Commons honour of Privy Councillor?  If so
it would be to me a genuine pleasure to be the channel of
conveying it.  You ought to have had it long ago.  I may
add that in the highest quarter gratification would be felt.
I have taken soundings.  I think we have done and are doing
pretty well.  The Government are pretty well the pick of
the basket, though there are some good men left out, and I
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P524"></a>524}</span>
think we can make it a change of policy and not a mere
change of men.  All seasonable wishes to you and
yours.&mdash;Yours always,

"Knowing you to be a wise man," wrote Lord Selby,
who had been Speaker of the House in three of the six
Parliaments of which Mr. Labouchere had been a member,
"I was not surprised to see that you had made up your mind
to eschew Westminster, and enjoy Florence and its climate,
but if I were still in the Chair I should miss you in the next
Parliament, and I am sure the smoking-room will be a forlorn
place without you; and I do not see how the loss is to be
repaired, for it takes a good many years to grow a plant of the
same kind.  I wish you and Mrs. Labouchere long leisure
and much pleasure in your Italian home, seasoned with
occasional visits to England.  The election may be said to
have begun with Balfour's speech at Leeds, and Campbell
Bannerman's at the Albert Hall...."
</p>

<p>
The leader of the Irish party wrote from Dublin:
</p>

<p>
"DEAR LABOUCHERE,&mdash;When writing the other day, I
did not know that you had any idea of retiring from Parliament.
I learned your intention with deep regret.  You have
been so long one of the truest friends of Ireland that you will
be missed by us all, and at a time when we can badly spare
a real friend.  With heartiest good wishes, and many thanks
for your advice and assistance on so many occasions, I remain
very truly yours,

"I have just read your farewell to Northampton," wrote
Sir Wilfrid Lawson, on December 17, "and it has troubled
me.  I am going to stand again for Cockermouth (I am older
than you!) with a <i>fair</i> chance of success, but, if I win and
get back to the House, I shall feel that it is not exactly the
same place without you.  I therefore just write this to say
how sorry I am to lose you.  Certainly you have always held
up bravely and ably the banner of the Radicalism in which
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P525"></a>525}</span>
I believe, and it remains to be seen whether we shall get it
as well held up in the Parliament which is to be.  Any way
those who believe in Government 'of, for, and by the people,'
ought to be grateful to you for your persistent preaching and
teaching of that doctrine.

<p>
"The new Government promises well, but I remember a
story on which you trenchantly commented in <i>Truth</i> some
years ago.  When Lord Dudley was married it was proposed
in the Kidderminster Corporation that they should give him a
wedding present, on which an old weaver rose and suggested
that it should be postponed '<i>till we see how he goes on</i>.'
</p>

<p>
"Well, I hope that you will go on well and happily till the
end of your days, and, meantime, not forget to give outside
help to your old comrades, who for a bit longer are grinding
in the Parliamentary mill."

<p>
Lord James of Hereford wrote:
</p>

<p>
"The announcement of your departure from the House
of Commons seems almost to affect me personally.  I recall
a day in the end of August, 1868, when you and I and John
Stamforth were sitting in front of the Kursaal at Homburg.
You and I were discussing our relative chances in Middlesex
and at Taunton, and then you asked Stamforth how he was
getting on at Athlone.  "I am member for Athlone,"
replied that unfortunate man, who afterwards, as you know,
polled one vote.
</p>

<p>
"Well, the water has been flowing on since then.  You and
I have seen a good deal of political life, and taken a fair
share in it.  I hope we have not done much harm, but
Heaven only knows.  I am very sorry that you are not
continuing in the fight....
</p>

<p>
"I know how little I can do, for I am three years older than
you are&mdash;but the House of Lords offers some opportunities
for easy going to an old one."

<p>
"DEAR LABOUCHERE," wrote Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice,&mdash;"We
have enjoyed sweet converse together in the House
of Commons and in the woods of Marienbad on 'men and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P526"></a>526}</span>
things.'  We are both leaving the House of Commons at
the same time, so I send you a word of greeting&mdash;or farewell,
or by whatever other name it may be appropriate to describe
these words....  A short Parliament generally follows
a long Parliament, and I expect to see this canon once
more illustrated."

"The <i>New York Herald</i> of this morning announces your
appointment as a P. C.," wrote Sir Edmund Monson from
Paris.  "I am very glad that you have received this distinction,
which, in my own case, I have always regarded as the
most acceptable of all that have been bestowed on me....
I can quite understand your relinquishing Parliament, and
I hope you may long enjoy the <i>otium cum dignitate</i> which no
place better than Florence can supply....  Believe
me, always your sincere old friend,

<p class="noindent">
"EDMUND MONSON."
</p>

<p>
Lord Brampton wrote on the last day but one of the
year: "I have just received your note.  Your reasons for
retirement from Parliament are unreasonable.  But, as
far as I am concerned, although I have not a word of
objection to offer, still I remain <i>sorry</i>.  With all my heart I
rejoice in to-day's <i>Times</i>, and offer to you, my right
honourable friend, my heartiest congratulations to you and all
yours, and every good wish for the coming New Year.  I
wish I could avail myself of your invitation to Florence,
but I fear I have no chance, as I am very weak still and can
hardly hold a pen."
</p>

<p>
Only one other letter must be quoted from the friends
of Labby's youth.  Sir Henry Lucy wrote on Christmas
Day:
</p>

<p>
"MY DEAR LABOUCHERE,&mdash;You will find in the forthcoming
issue of <i>Punch</i> some reflections on 'The Sage of
Queen Anne's Gate,' from the Diary of Toby, M.P.  I
believe they echo the feeling of the whole House of Commons,
irrespective of party, at the prospect of your withdrawal
from the scene.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P527"></a>527}</span>
</p>

<p>
"But why cut Westminster altogether?  There is still the
House of Lords.  If I might behold you walking out shoulder
to shoulder with the Archbishop of Canterbury to vote
'content' or 'not content' as the case might be, I should feel
I had not lived in vain....  With a warmth and friendship
dating back nearly thirty years&mdash;Eheu! we were colleagues
on the <i>World</i> staff in 1875."
</p>

<p>
Toby, M.P., recalled in a pathetic little article in <i>Punch</i>
the way Mr. Gedge had tried to do Labby out of his corner
seat below the gangway, where Sir Charles Dilke had sat
beside him on one side of the House or the other ever since
Mr. Gladstone's Parliament of 1892.  In order to secure a
seat in the House, members had to be present at the reading
of prayers, during which any one could slip a card with his
name upon it into the back of the place he wanted.  Now
Labby was never at prayers, and yet, Mr. Gedge noticed,
he had always had the same seat secured to himself in the
orthodox manner.  Accordingly, one day he allowed his
thoughts to wander whilst the House of Commons devotions
were proceeding, and his eyes followed his thoughts.
Between his fingers held devoutly before his face, he peeped,
and noticed Sir Charles Dilke, buried in prayer as usual.
Then he saw his devotion relax for a moment.  Sir Charles
was slipping a card into the back of the seat which he intended
to secure for himself, and Mr. Gedge was horrified to see that
he proceeded to slip a card with Labby's name upon it into
the back of the next one&mdash;the coveted corner seat below the
gangway.  Mr. Gedge subsequently drew the attention of
the House to this piece of underhand dealing, but
honourable gentlemen did not choose to take any notice of
what would clearly not have been observed, if Mr. Gedge
had been paying proper attention to his prayers.
</p>

<p>
A propos to the seating accommodation in the House
of Commons, it should be remembered that as far back as
1893, when the disgraceful scrimmage for seats took place
at the introduction of Mr. Gladstone's Home Rule Bill,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P528"></a>528}</span>
Mr. Labouchere had begun to agitate for a new House of
Commons with seats for every member.  He explained to a
journalist at the time his plan for an ameliorated House:
</p>

<p>
"At present," he said, "a man goes before a constituency
and, after a lot of trouble and expense, wins a seat&mdash;so it is
called.  He then comes up here to Westminster, and finds he
has gone through only half the preliminaries necessary for
securing a seat.  He has taken only the first steps, which are
simply child's play to what he has yet to do.  Getting
elected is simply nothing comparatively.  First I wanted an
octagonal chamber," he proceeded, "but I find general
opinion will retain the present form.  So my idea is to have
eight rows of seats on each side of the House, curving round
at the end opposite to the Speaker.  If each row will seat
forty-two members, you will find that will provide a seat
for the whole six hundred and seventy-two.  Then every
one could retain his seat throughout the session.  The
difficulty about the square shape of the House is that it gives
you an equal number of seats for each party and the
Government is generally in a majority.  That is why I would run
the seats round at one end&mdash;so that the supporters of the
Government could have the whole of one side, and as far as
the second gangway on the other.  Having a broader House
would necessarily mean enlarging the Press and Strangers'
Galleries also.  All the members are in favour of it, with the
exception of the front benches.  They have got their seats
assured, so they say that the House is cosy, and to enlarge it
would force them to pitch their voices higher."  The
journalist who was interviewing him commented on the extreme
moderation of his designs for an ameliorated House of
Commons.  "Oh," remarked Mr. Labouchere, "these are
just the alterations we shall probably make.  What I
personally should have liked would be to clear the Lords
out of their House, which is bigger than the House of
Commons, and install ourselves therein."[<a id="chap19fn4text"></a><a href="#chap19fn4">4</a>]  Eight years
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P529"></a>529}</span>
later he went to Vienna, and poured forth in <i>Truth</i> the
story of his envy when he saw the Austrian House of
Deputies:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
I went to see the Parliament House, and, after inspecting it,
I felt that I could with pleasure join a mob to disinter the remains
of the eminent architect who built the Palace at Westminster
and hang his bones on a gibbet.  The Vienna architect has
erected a building which is Parliament Architecture.  Everything
is adapted to the wants and requirements of those who want to
use it.  The members of each of the two Chambers sit in a
semi-circular room, and each member has an armchair and a desk
before him.  The general objection made to this plan of a
deliberative room is that it obliges members to speak from a tribune.
But at Vienna they speak from their places, and, owing to the
excellent acoustic properties of the Chamber, they can be
perfectly heard.  I went over the place in the company of a priest
who was visiting it at the same time.  He perceived that I was
an Englishman, and asked me how the place compared with the
English Parliament House.  "The members in England," I
said, "sit in an oblong room, in which there are only places for
half their number."  "But what do the others do?" he asked.
"They do not listen to the debates," I replied; "they seldom
know what is under discussion.  A bell rings and they come in,
and are told to vote as their leader orders them."  As a good
Radical I felt it necessary to give a further explanation, so I
continued: "The majority of the members are the supporters of
the Government; it is one of the worst Governments with which
a country was ever cursed; it is called the 'stupid party,' and
it is composed of Junkers and men who have made much money.
They want the laws to be made for their benefit, and not for the
benefit of the poor."  "But why," he said, "do they have a
majority, for I suppose that the poor have votes as well as the
rich, and there must be more poor than rich in England?"  "They
gained their election by corruption and falsehood," I
answered.  "Their wives and their daughters went about giving
the electors feasts, and they went about saying everywhere that
the Radicals wanted to destroy the Empire.  In this way they
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P530"></a>530}</span>
bought some with gifts, and others they deceived with falsehoods.
Soon the electors discovered how they had been fooled,
and for five years they have wanted to take away the Government
from the 'stupids,' but, by our laws, a Parliament is elected for
seven years, and the country is still obliged to submit to the
disgrace of having such a Government for one or perhaps two more
years.  Then there will be another election, and the 'stupids'
will be in a minority, and the Radicals who represent the
sense and intelligence of the country will become the
Government."  "And the Radicals," he said, "will, I suppose, make a
Chamber large enough to hold all the members."  "I am not
sure of that," I answered.  This seemed to surprise him, but he
thanked me for having made clear to him the party differences
in England.[<a id="chap19fn5text"></a><a href="#chap19fn5">5</a>]

But my story is wandering backwards instead of forwards.
And so stories usually do in the City of Flowers, where the
present is so full of ease and pleasure that a man's mind is
free to linger where it will, either lazily in the middle ages,
or to stray with graceful discrimination in the bye paths of
memory to find the savour again of some of the deeds of a
gallant past.  He may choose, perhaps, to grasp contentedly
and almost without effort, the gifts of the gods that lie
about in profusion, but he must always remember that care
and earnestness, strenuousness and ambition have no place
in Florence.  It was of course a home after Mr. Labouchere's
own heart.  He went to London in the January of 1906
to be sworn in as a Privy Councillor, and, in February, he
came back with delight to his villa to enjoy the merry
continental <i>train de vie</i> he had always loved.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Whilst in London, he wrote to Mr. Edward Thornton,
who was then in India:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
I did not, as you see, stand.  At seventy-four one gets bored
even with politics.  I am only over here for a fortnight, as I have
to get sworn into the Privy Council.  The Unionists have been
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P531"></a>531}</span>
beaten badly, because they seem to have gone out of their way
to court defeat.  One never knows what may happen, but they
will remain in a minority for the next twenty years, if they run
on Protectionist lines.  Joe swaggers and has captured the
machine, and Balfour would do well to fight him instead of
knocking under to him.  The Chinese labour helped us greatly.  They
ought to have known that the old anti-slavery feeling is still
strong, but they seem to imagine that every one has Rand
shares....  The really important thing connected with the
election is the rise of a Labour Party.  I do not think, however,
that there are above six M.P.'s returned who are <i>bona fide</i>
and Socialists, they are all jealous of each other.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
He wrote to Mr. Thornton again on March 10:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
I had had enough of Parliament, for one gets bored with
everything....  I have not the slightest notion what a Privy
Councillor is, except that I had to take half a dozen oaths at a
Council, which were mumbled out by some dignitary, and then
Fletcher Moulton, who was also being sworn in, and I performed
a sort of cake walk backwards.  I don't precisely know whither
we shall go in the summer&mdash;for it is such a relief to let the day
take care of the day.  It is lucky C. B. has so large a majority,
otherwise things would have been difficult with the Labour
lot&mdash;far more difficult than with the Irish.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Mr. Labouchere's most regular correspondent up till the
time of his death in January, 1911, was Sir Charles Dilke.
The friendship between them had continued uninterruptedly
since 1880.  Two letters that Mr. Labouchere wrote to Sir
Charles Dilke in 1910 have an especial interest, bearing as
they do upon the problem that had always interested
Mr. Labouchere so keenly throughout the whole of his political
career, and which, in the first twentieth century Liberal
Parliament, had assumed a new aspect.  The first of these
letters was written on February 11:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
MY DEAR DILKE,&mdash;What is the Government going to do in
regard to the Lords?  I can understand a one-Chamber man, in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P532"></a>532}</span>
default of getting directly what he wants, trying to get it indirectly,
by having a sham Upper Chamber.  But if the Government has
to appeal to the country on a suspensory veto, I doubt this creating
much enthusiasm.  If it be carried, this suspensory vote would,
of course, be used by the Peers for all that it is worth when a
Liberal Government is in to throw <i>batons dans leurs roues</i>.  I
should have thought, with the experience of the last Parliament,
that it would be realised that Peer obstruction, cleverly managed,
could reduce any Liberal Government to ridicule and contempt.
So long as a Reform is hung up by the Lords, the electors have
no heart in further Liberal legislation, which, in its turn, would
also be hung up.  A Party with a H. of C. majority at its back
cannot afford to be unable to carry through its measures.  Why
not go at once for the abolition of the H. of Peers, and its being
replaced by some sort of an elected Upper Chamber?  Nothing
is easier than to contrive one.  The basis would be the constitution
of the U.S. Senate <i>mutatis mutandis</i>.  It should have only
one half of the membership of the H. of C., and if the two Houses
cannot agree, then they should sit and vote together on the issue.
Notwithstanding the curious way in which Senators are elected
in the Senate of the U.S., I never heard of any serious proposal
to alter this.  Its main strength is due to its executive powers,
and this we need not provide for in our Senate.  With any
reasonable plan of election, and the members reduced to about
300, it is odds against there ever being a majority of one Party
of above 40 or 50.  No Government at present can get on
long without a certain majority of slaves of more than this in
the Commons, so the Commons would always get their way.  I
have been at times a President of and a member of several
Abolition of Lords Associations, and have advocated abolition
in thousands of speeches in the country.  The feeling was
generally against hereditary Legislators, for this comes home to all
as an absurd abuse.  If I were in the House I would move an
amendment on the Address against hereditary Legislators, and
the vast majority of the Government supporters would vote for
it, as they would most of them be afraid of their electors.  What
surprises me is that the Unionists do not counter the plans of the
Government by many such an amendment.  They are sacrificing
what is their interest to a lot of obscure Peers, who are of no
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P533"></a>533}</span>
importance.  As for the House of Lords, with only a suspensory
veto, it is worthless to them, except for tactical obstruction in
order to discredit a Liberal Government.
</p>

<p>
It is rather curious that if the H. of C. reflects the opinions
of the country there is a majority for Tariff Reform, as all the
National M.P.'s are Protectionists.  As it is, they will find it
difficult to vote for the Budget, with O'Brien painting Ireland
red against it.  He is a power in Ireland, and Redmond is
perfectly aware of it.  Anyhow the manœuvring in the H. of C. and
the Debates will be amusing.  There will be difficulties with
the Labour men, headed by Keir Hardie.  If I were the Unionists
I would buy him.&mdash;Yours truly,

H. LABOUCHERE.

<p>
The second was written on November 17, and ran as
follows:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
MY DEAR DILKE,&mdash;... It is a curious thing that in the
discussions about Home Rule all round, no one has pointed out
that in the German Empire Bavaria occupies a peculiar position.
It has far more independent rights than any other State.  It was
only on these terms that it came into the Empire, for there is no
great love lost between the Prussians and the Bavarians.  Yet
it sends its quota of representatives to the Reichsrath.  Therefore
there seems to me no particular reason why, if there be Home
Rule all round, the position of Ireland should not be that of
Bavaria.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I confess that I do not think much of the Government proposal
in regard to the veto.  It seems to me a stupid arrangement.
The Upper Chamber is a fifth wheel on the coach which only can
make itself a nuisance by persistent obstruction, which in two
years is swept aside automatically.  My experience in going to
lots of anti-Lords Meetings led me to the conclusion that the
country hates an Upper Chamber on hereditary lines, but does
not quite believe in a Single Chamber which is absolute master.
Why does no one propose to "scrap" the H. of L. and to have an
elected Upper House, one-third of whose members are renewed
by election every two years, or some such period?  This would
be on the lines of the U.S. Senate, only with a popular franchise,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P534"></a>534}</span>
instead of the strangely illogical one of the U.S.  Such an Upper
Chamber would probably be conservative in the real, and not the
party sense of the word, and yet command respect.  It would
rarely act except when the decision of the H. of C. was influenced
by a small minority, threatening to turn the Government out if
it did not knock under to it.  Were the Unionists to come forward
with such a scheme, they might very probably get a
majority.&mdash;Yours truly,

<p>
After Sir Charles Dilke's death, Mr. Labouchere wrote the
following interesting letter to Lord Channing, dated Feb. 18:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
DEAR CHANNING,&mdash;No, I am not writing any memoirs.  I
shall find it more agreeable to read yours than to do so....
I knew him (Dilke) very well since his start in politics.  When
in the House, he was the only man well up, particularly in
domestic legislature, and, really, it is thanks to him that many
useful measures were passed.  In explaining them, however, he
was too apt to lose himself in minor details.  In foreign politics
he never clearly knew what he wanted, and he was given to
believe in mares' nests which he thought he had picked up
abroad....  He fancied that he would be able to become
the leader of the Labour M.P.'s.  They were ready to
profit by his speeches, but it soon became clear that they
would only have a Labour M.P. for their leader.  We started
a sort of Labour Party with a Whip.  But they came to me
and said that it must be understood that he was not to be
either President or Chairman.  In the main this was due to
jealousy of him....  I did all that I could with Campbell
Bannerman for him to be in the Cabinet.  Campbell Bannerman
hesitated.  Then Morley made a speech asserting that the
Liberals would not be satisfied unless he was included.  At once
the Bishop of Rochester and a head dissenter (I think it was
Clifford) published letters protesting.  Campbell Bannerman
then pointed to these letters, and said that we should have a
split in the party if he were in the Cabinet.  Personally, I quite
agree with you as to his ostracism from office, but you know
what the English are, and particularly the dissenters....
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P535"></a>535}</span>
</p>

<p class="quote">
Why did you resign your seat?  It was a perfectly safe one.
I resigned because I had got to an age, when I got tired out at
a long sitting.  It is curious I was with Campbell Bannerman
and his wife and mine.  She wanted him to give it up, as his
doctor had told him that he ought to.  I urged him to go on.  He
said that this was odd advice, when I had said that I should
do so, and he was younger than I was.  I replied that it was
worth taking risks to be Prime Minister, but not for anything
else.  And he is dead and I alive....

H. LABOUCHERE.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
A great grief befell Mr. Labouchere in 1910.  He and
Mrs. Labouchere had been spending the summer as usual at
Villa d'Este and Cadenabbia, and had returned to Florence
in the early days of October.  Never had Mrs. Labouchere
appeared to be in better health and spirits.  On the evening
of the 30th October, she had delighted every one with her
inimitable reading aloud of <i>David Copperfield</i>, and life at
Villa Cristina, on that day, had seemed, if possible, more
joyous and serene than usual.  The next morning the blow
fell, but so gently as to be almost imperceptible.
Mrs. Labouchere, feeling a little giddy on rising, had returned to
her bed to allow the temporary sickness to pass off.  By the
afternoon she was beginning to slip away into unconsciousness,
and before the bells in the neighbouring convent had
begun to welcome the dawn of the Tutti Santi, she had gone
forth alone on her last long journey.
</p>

<p>
The winter of 1910 and 1911 passed quietly away for
Mr. Labouchere.  His days were cheered by the constant
presence of his daughter, who had married Marchesa Carlo
di Rudini, the son of the former Prime Minister of Italy, and
Mr. Thomas Hart Davies stayed with him till Christmas
Day, returning to Florence again in the early spring.  A
succession of visitors from England and Rome kept the house
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P536"></a>536}</span>
gay and lively as he loved to have it, always provided that
he had to take upon himself none of the activities or
responsibility of entertaining.  "I am merely a passenger on the
ship," he would say, when he wanted to wriggle out of any
active participation in the organisation of whatever might
be going on.  But it always happened to be towards the
corner of the ship where that particular passenger was
resting that the pleasure and interest of every one converged.
It was not so much the charm of his talk, that was, perhaps,
more entertaining in his old age than it had ever been, as the
extraordinarily youthful and never failing interest that
he continued to take in the affairs of every one else that
made him the best conversationalist in the world.
No little event of the smallest human interest was
too trivial to amuse him, and to awake the never
failing source of his mother wit.  He passed the summer at
Villa Cristina and went to Villa d'Este in September.
Though his spirits were as gay and unflagging as ever
throughout the winter, it was easy to see that his
physical strength was beginning to weaken.  The walk which
he took daily round his garden fatigued him so much that,
by Christmas, he had given up even that mild form of
exercise.
</p>

<p>
He experienced another bereavement during the winter in
the death of his oldest and most intimately associated friend,
Sir George Lewis.  He felt his loss very deeply, and I
remember that when he told me the news his voice was full
of emotion.  He related that Sir George Lewis had always
looked upon him as his <i>mascotte</i>.  "As long as you're alive
and flourishing, Labby," he used to say, "I shall be all right
too, so mind you take care of yourself."  "Just shows what
nonsense all those things are," continued Mr. Labouchere,
"for here am I as well and strong as ever, and there is
poor Lewis dead and gone."  The return of Mr. Hart
Davies to the Villa early in December cheered him up
immensely, and his devoted friend did not leave his side
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P537"></a>537}</span>
again, until the last sad morning when he bade farewell to
him on the hill of San Miniato.
</p>

<p>
It was fitting perhaps that almost the last letter that
Mr. Labouchere should have written, should have been to one of
his old theatrical friends.  Mr. Charles James Sugden, the
actor, wrote to him and asked him to write a preface to his
(Sugden's) forthcoming volume of Reminiscences.  Here is
Mr. Labouchere's reply:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
VILLA CRISTINA, Jan. 4, 1912.
</p>

<p class="quote">
MY DEAR SUGDEN&mdash;You ask me to write a preface to your
forthcoming book.  I don't think that I ever read one in my life,
for they always seem to be platitudes, impertinently thrust
forward by some person who has an exaggerated idea of his own
importance, in order to hinder me from getting at what I really
do want to read.  Good wine needs no bush, and I shall be
greatly disappointed if I do not derive great pleasure from
reading yours, for you have been brought into close contact with so
many persons of note in their day, and some of whom are still
in this world, and can throw many sidelights on them, and know
many anecdotes about them.  Pray bring it out as soon as
possible.  I am now over eighty, and at about that age senile
imbecility commences, so I do not want it to make progress
before I have had the opportunity to read the book and can
appreciate it.[<a id="chap19fn6text"></a><a href="#chap19fn6">6</a>]&mdash;Yours truly,
</p>

<p class="quote">
H. LABOUCHERE.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
But it was not until the beginning of the second week in
January that we all felt certain that he would never be well
again.  He was sauntering along so gently and carelessly,
as only Labby knew how to saunter, towards the brink of
the dark river.  When the little heaps of cigarettes, that
were arranged about his library so as to be always ready to
his hand, ceased to dwindle as usual, it became clear to each
and all that he must be very ill indeed.  As simply as a child,
tired with play, he took to his bed on the 11th of January,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P538"></a>538}</span>
and did not get up again.  He died peacefully at midnight
on January 15, 1912.
</p>

<p>
The earliest remark of Mr. Labouchere's that I have
recorded in this book was a jest, and so was the last I heard
him utter.  On the afternoon of the day before he died, as
I was sitting at his bedside, the spirit lamp that kept the
fumes of eucalyptus in constant movement about his room,
through some awkwardness of mine, was overturned.
Mr. Labouchere, who was dozing, opened his eyes at the sound of
the little commotion caused by the accident, and perceived
the flare-up.  "Flames?" he murmured interrogatively,
"not yet, I think."  He laughed quizzically, and went off
to sleep again.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
The words in which Mr. Hart Davies conveyed the news
of his end to Carteret Street are so beautiful in their simple
directness that no others can fitly replace them in this
biography:
</p>

<p>
"His mind always remained perfectly clear.  He took a
lively interest in the German elections, the political crisis in
France, and the events of the Italian-Turkish War.  He was
ever one for whom nothing that concerned the human race
(<i>nihil humani</i>) was alien to his vivid intelligence.  But his
bodily powers were constantly declining, and on Monday,
January 15, just before midnight, the end came, peacefully
and painlessly, a fitting termination to the career of one who
had ever been a fighter and ever in the forefront of the battle.
</p>

<p>
"He was buried on Wednesday morning, under the cold
drizzling rain of the Florentine winter, at San Miniato, in the
same grave with his wife, who died some fifteen months before
him.  There, his tomb, at the edge of the western battlement
of San Miniato, looks over the Tower of Galileo and the
dark cypresses of Arcetri.  It may be said of him, as Heine
said of himself, that on his grave should be placed 'not a
wreath, but a sword, for he was a brave soldier in the war
for the liberation of humanity.'"
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P539"></a>539}</span>
</p>

<p>
Before his death, he had expressed a strong wish as to
the place of his burial.  He wanted to rest beside his wife
at San Miniato.  But, when the arrangements for the funeral
were about to be made, it was remembered that only
Catholics were permitted to lie in the beautiful cemetery of
the Florentines.  The difficulty seemed insuperable, and the
preliminary steps had already been taken to bury him in the
Protestant graveyard.  His daughter, however, determined
to leave no stone unturned so that she might carry out her
father's dying wishes.  An appeal was made to some municipal
authority, and, by an extraordinary coincidence, that
seemed to make Labby's funeral fit in with all the rest of his
strange paradoxical career, it was ascertained that, just
at that moment, the possession of the cemetery was passing
out of the hands of the religious body to whom it had
hitherto belonged, and was becoming the property of the lay
ecclesiastical authority of the city, and there had been no
time for new regulations or restrictions to be formulated.
There were, therefore, from a legal point of view, none in
existence, and so it turned out that Mr. Labouchere was
permitted to lie in the spot that he had himself chosen.
</p>

<p>
For many days after his death, the letters of condolence
and sympathy from all quarters of the globe continued to
pour into the deserted home.  Of these one must assuredly
be published, for it bears witness to the loyalty and affection
that was unfailingly manifested to him by the borough he
had represented for twenty-five years in Parliament.  It
was addressed to Marchesa di Rudini, by Mr. Edwin Barnes,
the Secretary of the Northampton Liberal and Radical
Association, and ran as follows:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
At a special meeting of the Executive Committee of the
above Association, held last night, the following resolution was
unanimously passed, which I was directed to send to you: "The
Liberals and Radicals of Northampton have heard with the
deepest regret of the death of the Right Hon. Henry Labouchere,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P540"></a>540}</span>
who, for more than a quarter of a century, faithfully represented
the Borough in the House of Commons.  The members of the
Executive of the Northampton Liberal and Radical Association
hereby place on record the profound gratitude of all its members
for the loyal service which Mr. Labouchere rendered to the cause
of Democracy during so many years.  Whoever faltered, he
stood firm, and it will always be a proud remembrance that
Northampton also stood firm, and that there was no break in
the mutual confidence of member and constituents.  To his
daughter, the Marchesa di Rudini, and other members of
Mr. Labouchere's family, we offer our sincerest sympathy in the
irreparable loss that they have sustained, and trust they may
find some consolation in the warm tributes that have been paid
by men of all parties to his life, character, and work."  Having
known Mr. Labouchere for many years, and being his agent in
the important election of 1900 (during the Boer War), allow me
to add my own personal sympathy and condolence with you.
